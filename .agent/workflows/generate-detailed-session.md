# Generate Detailed Shadowdark Session

This workflow guides you through creating a detailed, atmospheric session for a Shadowdark RPG campaign using the `shadowdark-module-generator` skill.

1.  **Gather Context (Analysis Phase)**
    - Read `campaigns/<CampaignName>/CAMPAIGN.md` for setting, tone, and active NPCs.
    - Read `campaigns/<CampaignName>/CAMPAIGN_NOTES.md` for current objectives and to-dos.
    - Read the most recent `Session XX - Title.md` file to understand the immediate previous events.
    - Identify the specific goal for _this_ new session.

2.  **Plan the Session Structure**
    - Outline 3-4 distinct "Parts" or scenes (e.g., Intro/Social, Exploration, Combat/Challenge, Climax).
    - Identify key NPCs to feature.
    - Determine the "Urgent Problem" or hook.

3.  **Drafting - Atmosphere & Description**
    - For each location, write a "read-aloud" block (using `>`) that appeals to at least 2 senses (sight + sound/smell).
    - _Rule:_ Descriptions must be grim, dangerous, and atmospheric.

4.  **Drafting - Encounters & Mechanics**
    - For every combat encounter, provide a full Shadowdark stat block.
      - Format: `**Name** AC X, HP Y, ATK ...`
    - Add _Specific_ mechanics:
      - DCs for tasks (Easy 12, Hard 15, Extreme 18).
      - Trap triggers, effects, and disarm conditions.
    - _Crucial:_ Use compass directions for all movement (North, South, etc.).

5.  **Drafting - Narrative & Roleplay**
    - Write specific dialogue lines for NPCs, not just summaries.
    - Ensure choices matter: list "If the party does X..." options.

6.  **Review & Refine**
    - Check: Are there sufficient hooks for the next session?
    - Check: Is the formatting consistent with the project standards?
    - Check: Did you update `CAMPAIGN_NOTES.md` if any extensive planning changed?

7.  **Final Output**
    - Save the file as `campaigns/<CampaignName>/Session XX - Title.md`.
