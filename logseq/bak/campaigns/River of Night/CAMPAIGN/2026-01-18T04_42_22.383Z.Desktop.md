### Session Design Considerations

When creating sessions for this campaign:

1. **Always reference previous sessions**: Players have ongoing relationships
   with NPCs
2. **Use the mansion as bookends**: Sessions typically start and end at the
   mansion
3. **Integrate League NPCs**: Can introduce famous adventurers as needed
4. **Build on established threats**: The Basilisk Cult, jungle dangers, ancient
   ruins
5. **Reward exploration**: Hidden locations, lost artifacts, valuable
   discoveries
6. **Maintain West Marches style**: Players choose where to explore next
7. **Balance horror and adventure**: Deadly dangers but also thrilling
   discoveries

### First Session Summary (for reference)

The first session should include:

- Attack on the road to the mansion
- Introduction of Lady Johnson and Allan Quatermain
- Discovery of secret chamber via puzzle
- Encounter with uncle's ghost
- Finding the regional map
- Unexpected safe area with magical healing for rest

**Important**: Players fought vampires previously, so avoid vampire encounters
early on but introduce them again later.

## Hex Locations of Note

**Hex 603**: Gorilla Statue - magical statue that transforms fruit into potions,
guarded by [apes](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/ape.md)  
**Hex 104**: Dig Site A - slaughtered archaeological camp, [Basilisk Cult](npcs/basilisk-cult/) attack
site  
**Hex 706**: [Basilisk Cult](npcs/basilisk-cult/) Temple - home of the Stone Warriors

(Reference [River of Night Adventure](../../shadowdark-library/adventures/ADVENTURES_GUIDE.md) for complete hex details)

## Tone and Atmosphere Guidelines

- **Constant ambient danger**: The jungle is always threatening
- **Discoveries have costs**: Ancient treasures come with deadly traps
- **NPCs can die**: Even named characters face real danger
- **Success feels earned**: Victories should require skill and strategy
- **Grim-dark with pulp adventure**: Balance darkness with exciting action
- **Colonial adventure aesthetic**: Think Indiana Jones meets Heart of Darkness

## Campaign Continuity Notes

Track between sessions:

- What NPCs the players have met and their relationships
- What locations they've explored
- What artifacts they've recovered
- Ongoing threats (Basilisk Cult status)
- Resources stored at the mansion
