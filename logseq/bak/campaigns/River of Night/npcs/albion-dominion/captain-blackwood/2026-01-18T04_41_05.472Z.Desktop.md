## Quotes

> "Efficient. I underestimated your observational skills. I calculated a 14% chance of discovery."

> "The Empire cannot afford sentiment, Colonel. You are erratic. Emotional. The algorithm demanded your removal."

> "Regrettably, I must now purge the witnesses. Calculations suggest I have a 60% chance of escape if I kill the nearest mercenary and jump through the window."

## Notes

Represents the cold bureaucratic evil of empire - valuing systems and efficiency over human life. His betrayal shows that the greatest threats aren't always supernatural monsters.
