# Session 4: The Serpent's Eye

#session #river-of-night #session-04 #serpent-eye #basilisk-cult

> **Campaign:** [[CAMPAIGN]] | **Notes:** [[CAMPAIGN_NOTES]] | **Previous:** [[Session 03 - Teeth in the Night]] | **Next:** [[Session 05 - The Burden of Beasts]]

## Introduction for the Game Master

Following the attack on Mivvin's Rest, the party is tasked with a
counter-reconnaissance mission. They must track the retreating cultists back to
their lair, map the location, and determine the cult's strength. This is **not**
an assault mission; the party is vastly outnumbered.

**Theme:** Tension, Stealth, and Horror. The party is entering the heart of
darkness.

**Shadowdark Mechanics:**

- **Stealth is Survival:** Combat should be a fail state for the first half of
  the session.
- **Traps:** The temple is trapped to keep intruders out.
- **The Escape:** The session ends with a Chase sequence.

## Part 1: The Trail of Blood

### The Briefing

The morning after the attack, the air is thick with smoke. Quatermain is grim,
bandaging a wound.

> "They hit us hard," Quatermain runs a hand through his thinned hair, grimacing
> as he tightens the bandage on his arm. His eyes scan the dense tree line,
> paranoid. "Damned snakes... they took three good men last night. Dragged them
> off screaming into the dark."
>
> He turns to look each of you in the eye, his expression steel. "But they got
> sloppy. In their bloodlust, they left a trail. I want you to follow it. Track
> it back to the source. Find where they came from. Find their nest."
>
> He steps closer, lowering his voice. "But listen to me closely. Do **not**
> engage unless given no other choice. We need intelligence, not martyrs. We
> need to know numbers, defenses, entry points. If you see a chance to sabotage
> their operations—take it. Burn their supplies, collapse a tunnel... but
> getting back alive with that map is the priority. We can't strike back if we
> don't know where to hit. Now go. And Godspeed."

### The Jungle Trek

The trail is easy to follow—trampled vegetation and blood. However, the jungle
keeps its own secrets.

**Random Encounter (d6):**

1.  **Quickstand:** DC 12 STR to escape.
2.  **Giant [Centipedes](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/centipede,_giant.md):** 1d4 Centipedes hiding in the brush.
3.  **[Cultist](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/cultist.md) Stragglers:** 2 Cultists carrying a wounded comrade. Easy to
    ambush.
4.  **Strange Idol:** A stone statue of a serpent with ruby eyes (trapped:
    poison gas if touched).
5.  **Monkey Thief:** Steals a shiny item (maybe a torch or potion) and runs up
    a tree.
6.  **Silence:** The jungle goes unnaturally quiet. Something big is nearby, but
    it passes.

## Part 2: The Temple Entrance (Traps)

The trail ends at the base of a jagged cliff face. Carved into the rock is a
gaping maw of a snake, the entrance to the underground temple.

### Trap 1: The Indiana Jones Pressure Plates

The hallway is lined with decorative tiles, each bearing a distinct relief
carving.

- **Trigger:** Stepping on "Surface World/Light" tiles.
- **Effect:** Dart volleys from the walls. +4 to hit, 1d4 damage + Poison (DC 12
  CON or paralyzed for 1 round).
- **Solution:** Step only on "Underworld/Darkness" tiles. DC 12 WIS (Perception)
  to notice the pattern.

**Safe Patterns (The Cult's Domain):**

- **The Crescent Moon:** Symbolizing the night. stepped on
- **The Coiled Serpent:** Representing the god below. stepped on
- **The Cracked Earth:** The entrance to the depths. stepped on
- **The Closed Eye:** Sleeping/dreaming in darkness. stepped on
- **The Obsidian Dagger:** Sacrifice. stepped on

**Unsafe Patterns (The Hated Light):**

- **The Radiating Sun:** The burning eye of the day. stepped on
- **The Soaring Hawk:** Looking down from above. stepped on
- **The Open Hand:** A sign of mercy (weakness).
- **The Lit Torch:** Artificial light is an insult.
- **The Blooming Flower:** Life that needs the sun.

### Trap 2: The Rolling Stone

A narrow, sloping corridor.

- **Trigger:** Tripwire at the bottom.
- **Effect:** A massive spherical boulder releases from the ceiling behind them.
- **Mechanic:** All players must make a DC 14 DEX check to outrun it to a side
  alcove or dive into the next room. Failure takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

## Part 3: The Ceremony

The party finds a vantage point (a high ledge or shadowed balcony) overlooking a
massive underground cavern.

### The Scene (Temple of Doom Style)

A lava moat separates the main temple floor from the rest of the cavern. The
heat is intense. Hundreds of cultists are chanting: _"Sshhh-ka! Sshhh-ka!"_

On a central obsidian altar, a High Priestess stands over a kneeling cultist who
holds two terrified children (ages roughly 8 and 10).

> Protocol demands sacrifice," the Priestess hisses, her voice amplified by the
> acoustics. "But the Stone God also demands service. You must choose, Brother.
> Which of your spawn ends today to feed the Earth? And which shall serve the
> Serpent?"

**The Choice:** The father, weeping but fanatical, must push one child into a
pit (presumably to a basilisk or lava) and hand the other to the Priestess to
become an acolyte.

**The Barrier:** The party **cannot** intervene directly. The lava moat is 30
feet wide, and there are hundreds of cultists. If they try to attack, arrows
rain down, not killing them immediately but forcing them back into cover. This
scene is meant to establish the cult's cruelty and the high stakes.

The father makes his choice (DM's discretion on which is more horrifying, or
roll a d2). The "chosen" child is taken away, the other is pushed...

## Part 4: The Hatchery

Moving deeper into the complex to avoid detection, the party stumbles into a
warm, humid chamber filled with the smell of sulfur and unwashed beast.

**The Room:**

- Two **Baby [Basilisks](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/basilisk.md)** (about the size of large dogs) are playing in a nesting
  pit.
- They are hideous but strangely cute in a monstrous way.
- Their gaze is not yet lethal, but causes "Slow" (Disadvantage on DEX
  checks/attacks) for 1 round on a failed DC 12 CON save.

**The Dilemma:** The party realizes these are future man-killers.

- **Kill them:** Easy to do (HP 10 each), but they will scream.
- **Steal them:** Valuable for research? Quatermain might want them? Difficult
  to carry (grapple check).
- **Leave them:** Riskier for the future war.

**The Wailing:** Regardless of the choice, or perhaps due to a clumsy move, one
of the babies begins to **wail**—a piercing, shrieking cry that echoes through
the tunnels.

> "SCREEEEEEEEE!"

Distant drums stop. The chanting ceases. Then, a roar of anger rises from the
main cavern. They have been found.

## Part 5: The Minstrels and the Escape

Just as the party prepares to run, they hear a familiar, out-of-place sound. The
strumming of a lute.

**The Minstrels of Sir Robin (or rather, Doctor Googoo)** A trio of bards, who
have been inexplicably following the party (perhaps hired by a rival or just
magically persistent annoyances), pop out from behind a stalagmite. They begin
to sing at the top of their lungs, completely blowing any remaining stealth.

**The Song of Brave, Brave Doctor Googoo:**

> _"Brave, Brave Doctor Googoo, he was not afraid to die!_ _He was not at all
> afraid to be killed in nasty ways!_ _Brave, Brave, Brave, Brave Doctor
> Googoo!_ _He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp!_ _Or to
> have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken!_ _To have his kneecaps split
> and his body burned away!_ _And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir
> Googoo!"_
>
> _"Brave, Brave Doctor Googoo, he saw the snakey lair!_ _He boldly hid behind
> the rock, and gasped for lack of air!_ _When danger reared its ugly head, his
> brave tail turned and fled!_ _Yes, brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Googoo!"_

> _"He saw the lava bubbling hot, and nearly wet his pants!_ _He watched the
> cultists chant and dance, and did a frightened dance!_ _And when the babies
> screamed aloud, he shrieked just like a bird!_ _The bravest scream that anyone
> has ever, ever heard!"_

**The Chase:** Cultists flood the hallways. The party cannot win this fight.

- **The Odds:** Dozens of armed cultists, plus maybe a handler with a juvenile
  basilisk.
- **Establish the Threat:** Describe the sheer number of torches coming down the
  corridor. "Run!" is the only option.

**The Cenote:** The party sprints through the tunnels, the cultists hot on their
heels. The path ends at a sheer drop-off into a massive underground sinkhole
(cenote). Far below (50 feet), they see dark, rushing water.

> "There's nowhere to go!" a cultist shouts, closing in. spear raised.

**The Jump:** The only way out is down.

- **Athletics DC 10:** To jump clear of the rocks and hit the deep water.
  (Failure takes 1d6 damage from hitting the side, but they still fall in).
- **The River:** The current seizes them, sweeping them away into the darkness,
  far from the temple and the cult.

## Conclusion

The party washes up miles downstream, battered, soaked, but alive. They have the
location of the temple. They know the horrors that await. And they know war is
coming.

**XP Award:**

- Surviving the traps.
- Witnessing the ritual (Intel).
- Finding the Hatchery.
- Escaping with their lives.

**Next Session:** The War Council. Planning the assault on the temple with
Quatermain's full force.
