## Quotes

> "Civilization? Is that what we call it? Polished buttons and waltzes while the jungle rots your boots off your feet."

> "Huzzard's a fool. He thinks drawing lines on a map makes the land ours. He hasn't seen what lives in the dark. I have."

> "Let them pass, boy! If he dies, he dies. If they can save him, let them try. Unless you _want_ him dead, Sterling?"

> "Don't look at me, Huzzard. If I wanted you dead, I'd have called you out for a duel like a gentleman. Poison is a woman's weapon. Or a coward's."

> "The men are ready, Colonel. Scared, but ready. They saw that Tree-Witch die. They think we can kill gods now."

## Notes

"Mad Jack" represents the experienced soldier who's lost his illusions but still does his duty. His madness is actually sanity - he's one of the few who truly understands what they're up against.
