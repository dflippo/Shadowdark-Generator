Represents the cult's religious fanaticism. The party witnessed her ceremony but
could not intervene due to the lava moat and overwhelming numbers. Her location
and fate remain unknown - a potential future antagonist.

**For GM:** Consider giving her a name and developing her backstory if she
becomes a recurring villain.
