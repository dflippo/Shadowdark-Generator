## Description

A massive wooden rabbit idol, twenty feet tall, constructed from roughly hewn jungle timber and nailed together with crude iron spikes. Its ears are lopsided, its painted eyes are jagged spirals of red ochre. It sits on four wooden wheels, like a child's toy made by a madman.

The idol appears hollow with a hatch in the belly, but initially contained nothing—no cultists, no bombs, just empty space and the smell of sawdust.

## Discovery

Found by the [[Albion Dominion]]'s 4th Arbalesters in a jungle clearing during their campaign against the [[Basilisk Cult]]. The Dominion soldiers surrounded it with crossbows trained, believing it to be a siege engine or trap.

Upon investigation (DC 12 INT), the party determined it was hollow and seemingly abandoned. The Quartermaster tagged it as "Property of the Crown: One (1) Idol, Rabbit, Wooden" and ordered it dragged back to the supply depot near [[Locations#Mivvin's Rest]].

The [[Basilisk Cult]] deliberately left it where the Dominion forces would find it, exploiting their tendency to confiscate and catalog everything they encounter.

---

## True Purpose

The Trojan Rabbit was actually a **portal device** created by the [[Basilisk Cult]]. By allowing the Dominion to bring it into their own camp, the cult created a backdoor into the heart of their enemy's defenses.

During [[Session 07 - The Jungle Strikes Back]], the rabbit activated:

- The wood began to twist and scream like living flesh
- A swirling vortex of purple light erupted from its belly
- Cultists and jungle beasts poured through the portal
- It served as the primary invasion route during the attack on [[Locations#Mivvin's Rest]]

## Destruction

The Trojan Rabbit was destroyed during the defense of Mivvin's Rest when the party defeated [[Maied]]'s assault. The portal collapsed when the idol was destroyed.

## Cultural Reference

Named after the "Trojan Rabbit" from _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, where King Arthur's knights build a giant wooden rabbit as a gift to the French, intending to hide inside it and infiltrate the castle—but forget to actually get inside, making the gift hilariously ineffective.

In this case, the [[Basilisk Cult]] succeeded where the Pythons failed: they created a wooden rabbit that _did_ serve as an effective infiltration device, exploiting the [[Albion Dominion]]'s bureaucratic obsession with cataloging captured items. The cult's version actually worked as intended.
