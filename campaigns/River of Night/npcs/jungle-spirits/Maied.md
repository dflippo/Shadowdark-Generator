**Location:** Star Map Temple (Session 06), Governor's Clearing (Session 07)  
**Status:** Deceased (killed in [[Session 07 - The Jungle Strikes Back]])

## Description

A nature spirit who appears as both a gentle
[dryad](../../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/dryad.md)/[treant](../../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/treant.md)
and a vengeful force of nature. Her transformation from helpful spirit to
furious avenger shows the cost of treating the jungle as an enemy.

## Forms

- Sweet old treant auntie
- Tree dotted with star-shaped yellow flowers

### **War Form (Session 07)**

- Flowers gone, eyes burning green fire
- Bark blackened and spiked
- Wielded staff the size of a sapling
- Voice like grinding earthquake
- Commanded jungle beasts

## Transformation Cause

The party killed her "kitties" (the mated
[panthers](../../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/panther.md) and
cubs from the Star Map Temple). When the Albion Dominion arrived and began
destroying the jungle, she learned of her children's death and blamed the party.

## Key Relationships

- **Her Panthers:** "My kitties" - protective mother figure
- **The Party:** Friendly until they killed her panthers
- **[[Captain Blackwood]]:** He wanted to shoot her in peaceful form
- **The Jungle:** Guardian and avatar

## Notable Events

**Session 06:**

- Peacefully encountered at Star Map Temple
- Traded Heavy Brass Cogs for shiny replacements
- Party could have befriended her permanently

**Session 07:**

- Attacked Dominion forces at Mivvin's Rest
- Commanded beast tide: flying squirrels, giant boars, vipers, shadow jaguars
- Directly confronted party about killing her children
- Defeated by party and Dominion forces
- Froze into twisted tree statue, face screaming

## Death

> "My... poor... babies... I... go... to... sleep... now..."

Her bark hardened into a lifeless, twisted tree in the center of the camp. Her
face frozen in silent scream - a permanent monument to the cost of the conflict
between civilization and nature.

## Quotes

### Peaceful:

> "Such pretty things! Would you trade? I give you gears, you give me sparkles?"

### War:

> "MURDERERS! FALSE KINGS!"

> "You take my land! You take my peace! And then... YOU TOOK MY CHILDREN!"

> "Did you think the forest would forget? Did you think I would not hear their
> screams?"

> "Hunt them, my lovelies! Feast on their soft flesh! Leave no bone unbroken!"

## Themes

Maied represents the consequences of treating nature as an obstacle to be
conquered. Her transformation from gentle guardian to vengeful mother shows how
violence begets violence. The party's pragmatic choice to clear the temple had
unforeseen tragic consequences.

## GM Notes

Her frozen form remains in the camp - potential:

- Future quest for druids/rangers to lay her spirit to rest
- Lumber for magical construction (controversial)
- Warning to those who would thoughtlessly destroy nature
- Possible resurrection/haunting if mishandled
