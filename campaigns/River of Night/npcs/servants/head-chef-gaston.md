**Status:** Alive

## Description

A nervous man with a formidable mustache who runs the kitchens for the formal
events at the Governor's Mansion.

## Appearance

- Formidable mustache
- Chef's attire
- Currently trembling (during investigation)

## Personality

- Professional and proud of his work
- Nervous when under suspicion
- Defensive about his kitchen's integrity
- Knowledgeable about wines and service

## Key Events

**Session 07 - After the Poisoning:**

Interrogated about Colonel Huzzard's poisoning. Provided key information:

> "I saw nothing! Nothing! The wine was sealed! Vintage 89! I opened it myself!
> Unless... the goblet? Who touched the goblet?"

## Evidence Provided

- **The Wine:** Confirmed it was properly sealed Vintage 89
- **The Goblet:** Suggested checking the ceremonial goblet
- Led to discovery of purple powder in the velvet storage case

## Key Relationships

- **[[Colonel Percival Huzzard]]:** Serves at formal dinners
- **The Party:** Witness and evidence source
- **[[Captain Blackwood]]:** Unknowingly assisted the poisoning attempt

## Notes

**Different from [[Martha]] the Cook:**

- [[Martha]] runs the field kitchen for workers
- Gaston handles formal dining for officers
- Two separate kitchen operations at Mivvin's Rest

His testimony helped narrow the investigation to the goblet rather than the
wine, leading to [[Captain Blackwood]]'s exposure.
