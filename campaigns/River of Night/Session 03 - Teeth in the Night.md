# Session 3: Teeth in the Night

## Introduction for the Game Master

This session is a turning point. The "safe haven" of Mivvin's Rest is violated, and the players are forced to react to immediate, visceral threats. It begins with a high-stakes chase through the jungle at night to save a friend, and ends with a desperate defense of their home against the Basilisk Cult.

**Theme:** Vulnerability and Escalation. The jungle is not just "out there"—it is coming for them.

**Shadowdark Mechanics:**

- **Darkness:** It is pitch black. Characters without torches are **blinded**.
- **The Timer:** Start a **1-hour real-time timer** the moment the chase begins. If torches run out, the party is helpless.
- **Light Vulnerability:** The enemy knows the players need light and will target it.

## Part 0: The Night Before

### Atmosphere

The session begins in the evening, shortly after dinner. The mood is relaxed. The players are winding down after their recent induction into the League. The air is filled with the scent of jasmine and the distant, rhythmic thrum of cicadas.

### The Relocation (Doctor Googoo)

> "Doctor, a word if I may? While your companions have been inducted into the League, Mr. Quatermain has raised... significant objections regarding your membership. He feels your lack of discipline is a liability."
>
> She sighs, glancing at Quatermain, who is glaring at Doctor Googoo from the doorway. "Furthermore, your snoring is keeping the _actual_ members awake. You are to be relocated to the servants' quarters with the laborers. Consider it a... probationary period. Prove you can take this seriously, and perhaps Allan will reconsider."

This is a **demotion**. He is being sent to the "kids' table" while the "real heroes" stay in the mansion.

### Meeting the Dwarves

Doctor Googoo (and any other players who join him for a drink) meets his new bunkmates. This scene is **critical** for establishing empathy.

**The Dwarves:**

- **Grimm Ironfoot (Foreman):** Gruff, older, smoking a pipe. He respects strength.
- **Durgan Coalbeard (The Victim):** Young, wide-eyed, and eager. He is star-struck by the "heroes."

**Roleplay Moment:**
Durgan approaches Doctor Googoo with a bottle of cheap but strong dwarven spirits. He sits on a crate, eyes wide with admiration.

> "Is it true then? What they say?" Durgan asks, leaning in. "Did you really fight a ghost in the old master's study? I heard you stared it down until it blinked!"
>
> He takes a swig of the spirits and wipes his mouth. "I want to be an adventurer one day. Not just digging ditches and hauling stone. I want to get out of this garden and see the world. See the mountains again."
>
> He pulls out a small, crude dagger he's been sharpening. "I don't care what Mr. Quatermain says. He called you a 'buffoon' and a 'liability,' but I saw you out there. You're not a joke, are you? You're a hero."
>
> He looks at you with desperate hope. "Show him he's wrong. Show them all."
>
> Then, he fumbles in his pocket and pulls out a smooth, grey river stone with a natural hole through the center. He presses it into your hand.
>
> "Here. My pa gave me this. Said as long as I hold it, the mountain watches over me. But... you're the one fighting monsters. You take it for tonight. Keep you safe from the ghosts." He grins, a gap-toothed, boyish smile. "Just give it back in the morning, yeah? Promise?"

**The Promise:** If Doctor Googoo accepts, he is now holding Durgan's "luck." This creates a powerful emotional debt.

**Goal:** Make the players _like_ Durgan. He's the "kid" of the group. Have him share a drink, ask for advice, or show genuine admiration.

## Part 1: Screams in the Dark

### Atmosphere

It is the dead of night. The jungle is a wall of blackness, alive with the deafening chorus of insects.

- **Doctor Googoo** is in the tent with the dwarves.
- **The Rest of the Party** is in the main house (guest rooms).

**Read the following:**

> "Sleep is heavy in this heat. But it shatters in an instant.
>
> A sound tears through the night—a raw, human scream of terror from the servants' quarters, cut short by a wet, crunching sound."

### The Awakening

**For Doctor Googoo:**

> "You wake up to chaos. The tent flap is ripped open, flapping wildly in the night breeze. The cot next to you—Durgan's cot—is empty. The canvas is shredded, and there is blood on the floor.
>
> Grimm Ironfoot is scrambling for his pickaxe, his face pale in the lantern light. 'The lad!' he roars, his voice cracking. 'Something took the lad! I saw it—eyes like burning coals! It dragged him into the dark!'"

**For the Main House Party:**

> "You hear the scream from the west. Looking out the window, you see commotion near the servants' tents. Dwarves are shouting, and you see a flashlight beam cutting wildly into the jungle.
>
> You hear Grimm's voice bellowing over the noise: 'To me! To me! They've got Durgan!'"

### The Situation

There is no time to plan. Durgan—the kid who wanted to be an adventurer—has been snatched.

- **The Blood Trail:** A wide swath of crushed ferns and blood smears leads **southwest** into the jungle.
- **The Clock:** Durgan is alive, but barely. Every moment wasted is a death sentence.
- **The Darkness:** The jungle is pitch black. **Start the Torch Timer.** Players must light torches immediately or be blind.

**Grimm's Plea:** Grimm grabs the nearest character by the arm. "Don't let them eat him! He's just a boy! He's got a mother in the Iron Hills who'll skin me alive if I let him die here!"

---

## Part 2: The Chase (Skill Challenge)

### Mechanics

Instead of a slow track, this is a **Chase**. The party must catch the predator before it reaches its lair.

- **Goal:** Accumulate **5 Successes** before **3 Failures**.
- **DC:** 12 (Skills: Wisdom/Survival to track, Strength/Athletics to sprint, Dexterity/Acrobatics to dodge roots, Intelligence/Nature to predict the beast's path).
- **Pacing:** Describe the frantic sprint through the dark jungle—thorns tearing clothes, roots tripping feet, the sound of heavy breathing and something large crashing through the brush ahead.

### The Torch Threat

The jungle fights the light. On a **Failed Check** during the chase, introduce a complication related to light:

1.  **Snuffed Out:** A character trips and drops their torch in a puddle. It goes out.
2.  **Moth Swarm:** Giant moths swarm the light, creating dim light (Disadvantage) for 1 round.
3.  **Separated:** A character stumbles into the dark and is separated by 30 feet. They are blind until they light a new torch or are found.

### Outcomes

- **Success (5 Successes):** The party catches up to the beast in a clearing _before_ it can finish its meal. Durgan is unconscious and bleeding (1 HP), but alive.
- **Failure (3 Failures):** The party arrives too late. They find the beast standing over Durgan's body. He is dead, his chest torn open. The emotional weight of the failure should be heavy.

## Part 3: The Jaguar's Kill

### Atmosphere

The chase ends in a small, moonlit clearing dominated by a massive Kapok tree. The air smells of copper and musk.

**Read the following:**

> "You burst through the foliage into a small clearing. Moonlight filters through the canopy, illuminating a nightmare.
>
> Perched on a low, thick branch is a jaguar—but it is wrong. It is massive, the size of a horse, its fur a shimmering gold marked with black rosettes that seem to swirl like smoke. Its eyes burn with a malevolent, amber intelligence.
>
> Beneath its massive paw lies Durgan [alive and groaning / silent and still]. The beast looks up at you, lips peeling back to reveal fangs the length of daggers. It doesn't roar. It _chuckles_—a low, rasping sound that vibrates in your chest."
>
> "Fresh meat..." a voice hisses, though the jaguar's mouth does not move. It is a psychic projection, heavy and oily in your mind. "The little one... he cried for his 'lucky stone'... pathetic. Now, I shall feast on his 'heroes'."

### Encounter: The Giant Jaguar

**Giant Jaguar (1)**
AC 14, HP 52, ATK 2 claws +5 (1d6+2) and 1 bite +5 (1d10+2), MV near (climb), S +3, D +4, C +2, I -3, W +2, Ch -1, AL N, LV 4

**Tactics:**

- **Verticality:** The jaguar uses its climb speed to stay out of reach, dropping down to **Pounce** (DC 14 STR or prone) and then retreating up the tree.
- **Darkness:** It strikes from the shadows. Characters without darkvision have Disadvantage on attacks if they don't have a light source.
- **Attack the Light:** The jaguar is intelligent. It knows the players need light.
  - **Tail Swipe:** Instead of a claw attack, it can try to knock a torch from a player's hand (DC 12 DEX check). If failed, the torch flies 1d4 x 5 feet away and extinguishes 50% of the time.
  - **Shadow Stalker:** It prioritizes targets holding torches, trying to drag them into the darkness.

**Quatermain:** If the fight goes poorly, Quatermain arrives late (having been woken by the commotion).

> "Down, you devil!" Quatermain shouts, firing a bolt that strikes the branch near the beast. "Back to the pit that spawned you!"

## Part 4: Smoke on the Horizon

### The Return

Win or lose, the party must carry Durgan (or his body) back to the mansion. The trek back is tense, adrenaline fading into exhaustion.

As they near the edge of the jungle, they smell something worse than blood. **Smoke.**

**Read the following:**

> "The mansion is just ahead. But as the trees thin, you see an orange glow lighting up the night sky. Thick, black smoke billows from the direction of the servants' quarters.
>
> And then you hear it—the clash of steel on stone, and the war-cry of the Basilisk Cult: 'Sshhh-ka! Sshhh-ka! Stone and Blood!'"

---

## Part 5: Sanctuary Under Siege

### The Attack

The **Basilisk Cult** has used the jaguar attack as a distraction. While the "heroes" were in the jungle, a strike team infiltrated the grounds to burn the servants' quarters and breach the mansion.

**The Scene:**

- **The Servants' Quarters:** Two tents are on fire. Dwarves and servants are fighting desperately with shovels and picks against masked warriors.
- **The Veranda:** Lady Johnson is pinned down behind a flipped table, firing a hand crossbow at cultists trying to smash the front doors.

### Objective

**Defend the Mansion.** The party must choose where to intervene.

1.  **Save the Servants:** 4 Cultists are slaughtering the unarmed laborers.
    > "Die, soft-skins! The Stone God demands it!" one cultist screams as he raises a spear over a cowering servant.
2.  **Protect Lady Johnson:** 4 Cultists and a **Cult Leader** are breaching the main house.
    > Lady Johnson shouts from the veranda, "Hold them back! Don't let them inside! Allan! Where the hell is Allan?!" She looses a bolt that catches a cultist in the shoulder.

**Basilisk Cultist (8)**
AC 13 (leather, shield), HP 16, ATK 1 obsidian spear +3 (1d8), MV near, S +2, D +1, C +2, I +0, W +1, Ch +0, AL C, LV 3
_Special: Fanatic (Immune to fear)._

**Cult Leader (1)**
AC 15 (chain), HP 24, ATK 2 obsidian swords +4 (1d8), MV near, S +3, D +1, C +2, I +1, W +2, Ch +2, AL C, LV 4
_Special: Command (Allies within near range have Advantage on attacks)._

### Tactics

- The cultists are suicidal. They want to cause maximum damage.
- If the party saves the servants, the dwarves rally and help fight.
- If the party rushes to Lady Johnson, the servants suffer heavy casualties (impacting future morale/services).

---

## Part 6: The Aftermath

### Atmosphere

The battle ends with the cultists dead or fleeing. The fires are extinguished, but the scars remain. The "safe" mansion is scorched, blood stains the veranda, and the illusion of safety is shattered.

**Read the following:**

> "The last cultist falls. The silence that follows is heavy, broken only by the crackle of dying fires and the weeping of the survivors.
>
> Lady Johnson steps out from the veranda, her face smeared with soot, her crossbow still in hand. She looks at the bodies of the cultists—men wearing stone masks—and then at you.
>
> 'They didn't come for the egg,' she says, her voice trembling with rage. 'They came for _us_. They wanted to show us that nowhere is safe.'
>
> Quatermain pulls a stone mask off a dead cultist and crushes it under his boot. He turns to Doctor Googoo, his eyes cold. 'You survived. Good. But survival isn't enough. This isn't a game, boy. People die when you treat it like one.' He gestures to the scorched earth. 'War, then. They want a war? We'll give them one.'"

### Rewards & Consequences

- **XP:** Awarded for the Jaguar and Cultists.
- **Durgan:** If saved, he swears a life-debt to the party. If dead, Grimm Ironfoot becomes a grim, vengeance-obsessed ally.
- **The Mansion:** Repairs will take time. The party may need to invest gold to fortify the defenses (walls, guards) for future sessions.

## Session Conclusion

The players should feel:

1.  **Relief:** They survived a chaotic night.
2.  **Anger:** Their home was attacked.
3.  **Determination:** They need to take the fight to the enemy.

**Next Session:** The counter-attack. The party must locate the Cult's temple and strike back before they can mount another assault.
