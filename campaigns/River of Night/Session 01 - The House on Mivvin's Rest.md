## Introduction for the Game Master

This session introduces the players to the Black River jungle, their new patron
Lady Lara Croft Johnson, and the central hub for their adventures: her manor at
Mivvin's Rest. The adventure begins with the party en route to the manor,
leading to a combat encounter that highlights the dangers of the jungle. This is
followed by roleplaying at the manor where they meet key NPCs and discover a
mystery within the house itself, culminating in a mini-dungeon crawl that
provides them with the map for the larger campaign.

## Part 1: Ambush on the Jungle Road

### Atmosphere

The adventure begins _in media res_. Read the following to the players:

> "The air is thick, hot, and alive with the buzz and chitter of a million
> unseen things. The narrow track you follow, barely wide enough for a single
> cart, is hemmed in on both sides by a suffocating wall of green. Giant ferns,
> thick-trunked trees draped in strangler vines, and bursts of impossibly
> colorful flowers create a claustrophobic canopy. The letter of introduction
> from Lord Johnson feels a world away as you press on toward his sister's
> estate, Mivvin's Rest. Up ahead, the path is blocked by a massive,
> moss-slicked log."

The log requires a combined **DC 12 Strength check** from two characters to
move. As the party deals with the obstacle, they are ambushed.

### Encounter: Lizardfolk Raiders

A war party of **four
[Lizardfolk](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/lizardfolk.md)**
and one **Lizardfolk Hunter** attacks. Two
[Lizardfolk](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/lizardfolk.md)
charge from the front, while two more emerge from the jungle on the eastern
flank. The Hunter remains hidden in the dense foliage to the west (DC 15 Wisdom
check to spot) and targets spellcasters or lightly armored characters with its
blowgun.

**[Lizardfolk](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/lizardfolk.md)
(4)**

- AC 14 (leather + shield), HP 11, ATK 1 spear (close/near) +2 (1d6), MV near
  (swim), S +1, D +1, C +2, I -1, W +1, Ch -2, AL C, LV 2

**Lizardfolk Hunter (1)**

- AC 13 (leather), HP 11, ATK 1 blowgun (near) +2 (1 + poison) or 1 obsidian
  dagger (close/near) +2 (1d6, Breakable), MV near (swim), S +1, D +2, C +2, I
  -1, W +1, Ch -2, AL C, LV 2
- **Poison:** The darts are tipped with a paralytic agent. A creature hit must
  succeed on a DC 12 Constitution check or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.
- **Breakable:** The obsidian dagger breaks on a natural 1 attack roll.

## Part 2: Johnson Manor

### Atmosphere

After the ambush, the party arrives at a large, manicured clearing containing a
magnificent, two-story colonial-style house with wide verandas. On the porch, a
weathered man introduces himself as **[[Allan Quatermain]]**. He offers the party
refreshments and informs them that [[Lady Johnson]] is expecting them but is unwell.

### Meeting the Patrons

A servant leads the party into the manor, which is filled with artifacts,
taxidermy, and maps, much like a museum.

**Lady Lara Croft Johnson:** The party finds her in a grand study, reclining on
a chaise lounge. She is sharp and intelligent but is clearly suffering from a
jungle fever, shivering despite the heat. She explains her illness prevents her
from exploring and proposes to fund the party's expeditions in exchange for a
share of their findings. She introduces her adventurer's guild, the **League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen**, and invites the party to join.

**[[Allan Quatermain]]:** He is a famed big-game hunter and explorer who serves as
[[Lady Johnson]]'s adviser and a potential resource for the party. He is wary of the
jungle's supernatural elements but is an unparalleled expert on its mundane
dangers, flora, and fauna. He can offer advice on travel and survival.

## Part 3: The Secret of the Study

### The Mystery

[[Lady Johnson]] mentions that she inherited the house from her eccentric uncle, a
cartographer who disappeared years ago. His old desk is still in the study.

### The Puzzle

On the desk is an ornate globe of the moon. Several astronomy books are nearby.
A bookmark in one contains a riddle:

> _"When the hunter is slain and the sea is at its lowest, my shadow reveals the
> way."_

**Solving the Riddle:**

1. On the large world globe in the corner, the players can find the
   constellation Orion ("The Hunter"). They must rotate the globe until Orion is
   below the horizon ("slain").
2. On the lunar globe, they must rotate it to the New Moon phase, which
   corresponds to the lowest tides ("the sea is at its lowest").
3. Once both conditions are met, a mechanism inside the lunar globe projects a
   faint beam of light onto a nearby bookshelf, outlining the shape of a keyhole
   on the spine of a book titled _On Celestial Alignments_.

The keyhole is a decoy. Pushing on the book's spine causes the entire bookshelf
to swing inward, revealing a dusty, dark passage.

## Part 4: The Uncle's Chambers

### Atmosphere

The air beyond the secret door is stale and cold. The walls here are bare stone.

### Area 1: Antechamber

A 15-foot square stone room. A single, clean line in the thick dust on the floor
leads from the entrance to a heavy oak door to the north.

**Trap:** A pressure plate (DC 15 Wisdom check to spot) is situated before the
northern door. If stepped on, iron portcullises slam down over the north and
south exits, trapping the party. A lever to reset the trap is hidden behind a
loose stone on the east wall (DC 12 Intelligence check to find).

### Area 2: The Cartographer's Workshop

This 20-foot by 30-foot room is a chaotic workshop filled with maps and
celestial instruments. A cold spot drifts through the room. There is a door to
the west and an archway to the east.

**The Ghost:** The
**[Ghost](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/ghost.md)** of
[[Alistair Johnson]] haunts this room. He appears as a sad, translucent man who
cannot speak but will try to guide the party toward a large, incomplete star
chart on a central table. He will only become hostile if his work is damaged. To
appease the ghost, the party must place several wooden, star-shaped pieces
correctly onto the chart to complete the local constellations. When the puzzle
is solved, a click sounds from the western door, and Alistair's ghost fades away
with a peaceful smile.

**[Ghost](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/ghost.md)**

- AC 13, HP 27, ATK 2 death touch +5 (1d8 + life drain) or 1 possess, MV near
  (fly), S -2, D +3, C +0, I +0, W +0, Ch +4, AL C, LV 6
- **Greater Undead:** Immune to morale checks. Only damaged by silver or magical
  sources.
- **Incorporeal:** In place of attacks, become corporeal or incorporeal.
- **Life Drain:** 1d4 CON damage. Death if reduced to 0 CON.
- **Possess:** Must be corporeal. One target, close range. Contested CHA check.
  If ghost wins, it inhabits target's body and controls it for 2d4 rounds.

### Area 3: The Hidden Sanctum

The western door opens into a small, circular chamber. The air is fresh and
clean.

**The Safe Haven:** In the center of the room, a small, ornate fountain of white
marble bubbles with crystal-clear water that glows with a soft, silver light.

**Magical Healing:** This is a **Font of Healing**. Any character who drinks
from it is healed for 2d6 hit points and is cured of any natural diseases.
Characters can only benefit from this healing once per day. The water can be
bottled but loses its potency after one hour. This is a safe place for the party
to rest.

### The Reward

With the ghost gone, the party can search the workshop. The eastern archway
leads to a small storeroom containing a locked chest (DC 12 Dexterity check to
pick). Inside, they find:

- A rolled-up map of the **Black River** region.
- Alistair's journal, detailing his research into ancient, dark temples and a
  coming solar eclipse.
- A bag with 150 gp and three emeralds (120 gp each).
- One **Potion of Healing**.

---

## Session Conclusion

The party can return to [[Lady Johnson]] with the map, journal, and a bottle of the
fountain's healing water. The water will cure her fever, and she will
enthusiastically hire them to explore the locations on the map, setting the
stage for the rest of the campaign.
