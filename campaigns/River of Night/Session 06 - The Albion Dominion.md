- ## Introduction for the Game Master

  The jungle is no longer a lawless frontier. The **[[Albion Dominion]]** has arrived.
  This session shifts the genre from **Survival/Horror** to **Colonial
  Satire/Social Intrigue**. The party must navigate a danger far worse than
  basilisks: **Bureaucracy and Etiquette.**

  **Theme:** Civilization vs. The Wild (and the absurdity of trying to tame it).
  **Shadowdark Mechanics:**

- **Carousing:** Downtime rules for the weeks of calm.
- **Social Reaction Rolls:** The Army's opinion of the party matters more than
  their HP.

  ***

- ## Part 1: The Rabbit in the Woods

  The session opens not with a battle, but with a baffling discovery. The
  Dominion’s vanguard—the 4th Arbalesters—has pushed the Cult back. Reports come
  in of a "Massive Siege Engine" abandoned in a clearing.

  **The Scene:** A platoon of Redcoats stands in a semicircle, heavy crossbows
  trained on a massive object. **Read Aloud:**

  > "In the center of the clearing, surrounded by the tense, sweating soldiers of
  > the Dominion, sits... a rabbit.
  >
  > It is twenty feet tall. Constructed of roughly hewn jungle timber, nailed
  > together with crude iron spikes. Its ears are lopsided. Its painted eyes are
  > jagged spirals of red ochre. It sits on four wooden wheels, like a child's toy
  > made by a madman."

  **The Investigation:**

- **The Sergeant:** "Careful, lads! It could be full of 'em! Ready the volley!"
- **The Reality:** The party can inspect it.
  - _DC 12 INT (Investigation):_ It’s hollow. There is a hatch in the belly, but
    inside... nothing. No cultists. No bombs. Just empty space and the smell of
    sawdust.
  - _Insight:_ It looks like it was _meant_ to hold something, or be pushed
    somewhere. But why leave it here?

    **The Dominion's Solution:** Since it’s not attacking them, the Quartermaster
    tags it: _"Property of the Crown: One (1) Idol, Rabbit, Wooden."_ They order it
    dragged back to the supply depot near Mivvin's Rest to be "processed later."

    ***
- ## Part 2: The Pax Albion (Downtime Montage)

  With the Army's arrival, the immediate threat of the Cult recedes. The party has
  **Three Weeks** of relative safety. Describe the transformation of Mivvin's
  Rest:

- Tents are replaced by prefab barracks.
- A "Governor's Mansion" is being erected.
- The smell of tea and oiled steel replaces the smell of rot.

  **Downtime Activities:** Ask each player how they spend these three weeks.
  1.  **Carousing (Socializing with the Officers):** _Cost: 10gp._
  - _Success:_ Gain a rumor or a favor.
  - _Failure:_ You offend a Lieutenant. 2. **Research (The Star Map):** _Cost: 50gp (Bribing archivists)._
  - _Result:_ Uncover legends of the "Sky-Callers" who used the ziggurats to
    speak to the stars. 3. **Training/Fortifying:**
  - Helping [[Durgan Coalbeard]] upgrade the defenses or training with the
    soldiers. 4. **[[Doctor Googoo]]'s Nursery:**
  - The Basilisks (Iggy and Pop) are hiding. The Army would kill them on
    sight. [[Doctor Googoo]] must keep them secret.

    ***

- ## Part 3: The Officer's Mess

  The climax of the session is a formal dinner hosted by
  **[[Colonel Huzzard]]** in the newly commandeered "Governor's Hall"
  (formerly part of Mivvin's Rest or a grand tent).

  **The Invitation:**

  > _"Colonel Percival Huzzard, 4th Arbalesters, requests the pleasure of your
  > company to celebrate the Pacification of the Sector. Proper attire is
  > mandatory."_

  **The Guests:**

- **[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** Large, ruddy-faced, wears a monocle.
  Believes the jungle can be beaten with "Discipline and Geometry."
- **[[Lieutenant Sterling]]:** Young, eager, desperate for glory. Thinks the
  party are romantic heroes.
- **[[Captain Blackwood]]:** The Intelligence Officer. Cold, suspicious. Watches
  [[Doctor Googoo]] closely.

  **The Social Combat:** The dinner is played in rounds, just like combat.
  **Initiative:** Roll CHA.

  **Round 1: The Soup Course (Manners)**

- **Challenge:** Using the correct spoon. Not slurping.
- **Check:** DC 12 CHA or WIS.
- **Failure:** [[Colonel Huzzard]] frowns. "A bit... rustic, aren't we?"
  (Disadvantage on next roll).

  **Round 2: The War Stories (Bragging)**

- [[Colonel Huzzard]] asks: "So, how exactly did you survive the Temple of the Serpent? I
  assume you used standard flanking maneuvers?"
- **Challenge:** Describing their chaotic adventures in military terms.
- **Check:** DC 12 CHA (Performance) or INT (History).
- **Success:** "By Jove! Unorthodox, but brilliant!"

  **Round 3: The Interrogation (Secrets)**

- [[Captain Blackwood]] leans in. "We've had reports of... creatures. Reptiles. Kept
  as pets. Surely not true, Doctor?"
- **Challenge:** Lying or deflecting.
- **Check:** DC 14 CHA (Deception).
- **Failure:** Blackwood notes this in his ledger. "Interesting."

  ***

- ## Part 4: The Star Map Reveal

  After the brandy is served, Huzzard drops the pretense. He dismisses the
  servants.

  **The Map:** He unrolls a large canvas map on the table. It is detailed, but one
  sector is circled in red ink: **Hex 44-B.**

  > **[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "We've secured the river. We've routed the savages. But
  > _this_... this is a problem."

  **The Situation:**

- The Army found a structure: **The Star Map Temple**.
- They sent a squad of engineers to secure it.
- **The Problem:** The engineers came back... wrong. Babbling about "The space
  between the stars" and "The eyes in the dark." Two are catatonic. One tried to
  eat his own boots.
- **The Request:** "My men are soldiers, not... whatever _you_ are. Exorcists?
  Tomb robbers? I need you to go in. Clear it out. Confirm it's safe for
  demolition."

  **The Reward:**

- "Do this, and the Dominion will officially recognize your claim to Mivvin's
  Rest. We will grant you a Charter. You will be landed gentry, not squatters."
- **The Catch:** "[[Captain Blackwood]] will accompany you. To observe."

  ***

- ## Part 5: The March

  The next morning, the party sets out for **Hex 44-B**.

- **The Companion:** [[Captain Blackwood]] accompanies them. He wears a pristine
  uniform and constantly makes notes in a leather ledger.
- **The Jungle:** The area around the temple is unnaturally quiet. The birds
  don't sing; they whisper.

  **Event: The Silent Ones** As they trek, they feel watched.

- _DC 12 WIS (Perception):_ You spot figures in the trees. Pale, stick-thin
  humanoids with featureless faces (**The Silent Ones**). They do not attack.
  They watch.
- **[[Captain Blackwood]]'s Reaction:** He doesn't see them. "Stop imagining things. Focus
  on the mission."

  ***

- ## Part 6: The Star Map Temple

  The temple is an open-air pavilion of ancient marble, untouched by the jungle's
  rot. It seems to glow with a faint, starlight ambiance even in the day.

  **1. Mossy Pillars (The Entrance)**

- **Description:** The mossy remnants of ancient marble pillars stand at
  precarious angles in this quiet, sunlit hall. The moss grows in distinct
  swirls and patterns on a few.
- **Secret:** _DC 14 WIS (Perception)_ or investigating the patterns. One pillar
  has a subtle secret door in its base.
- **Loot:** Inside acts a velvet bag holding an **Amulet of Secrecy**
  (Shadowdark Item).
- **Blackwood:** "Building code violations everywhere. Typical savage
  architecture."

  **2. Treant Lair (Maied)**

- **Description:** A tree dotted with star-shaped yellow flowers creaks gently
  in the breeze. Vines grow along the walls in unusual, wave-like patterns, and
  sparkling bits of metal glimmer among their tendrils.
- **Encounter:** The tree is **Maied**, a sweet old
  [treant](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/treant.md) auntie.
  - _Roleplay:_ She loves to decorate with nature and found objects. She is
    non-violent.
  - _The Puzzle Key:_ woven into her vines are **Heavy Brass Cogs** (Essential
    for Area 8).
  - _Negotiation:_ She won't part with them unless given "equally beautiful
    replacements." (Shiny gems, art objects, or a very good Performance check).
- **Blackwood:** Reaches for his heavy crossbow. "Timber! It's a monster!" _The
  party must stop him or Maied will crush him._

  **3. Hall of Paintings**

- **Description:** Heavily peeling frescoes cover the walls.
  - _Image 1:_ A citadel of rich green and red stone in the jungle (**The Lost
    City of Zuchotl**, Hex 92-I).
  - _Image 2:_ Indistinct, purplish shapes lifting and devouring white-clad
    human warriors.
  - _Insight:_ PCs familiar with the jungle recognize the silhouette of
    **Tsibalba Volcano** (Hex 12-B) painted in the citadel's background.

    **7. Panther Den (The Obstacle)**
- **Description:** Musky odor. Claw marks mar the white marble walls.
- **Encounter:** Two **Mated
  [Panthers](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/panther.md)**
  lurk in the shadows (DC 12 WIS to notice).
  - _Combat:_ They attack if approached.
  - _Alternative:_ Tossing food causes them to retreat.
  - _Details:_ Four cubs hide in a small den in the corner.
- **Blackwood:** "Finally, something I can shoot."

  ***

- ### The Wheels of Heaven (Puzzles & Boons)

  The central mechanic of the temple is a series of massive celestial wheels.

  **6. Star Wheels (The Objective)**

- **Description:** Three broad, connected wheels of bright copper. Patterns of
  dots and lines mark the seasonal movement of stars. Its inscription reads:
  _"Map of the heavens, guide our eyes and hearts."_
- **Effect:** Touching the wheel while the North Star is visible (Night) grants
  1 XP.
- **Relevance:** This is the **Star Map**. Rubbing graphite or ink on paper over
  these wheels produces the chart the Army needs.

  **4. Moon Wheels**

- **Description:** Two giant, interlocking wheels of untarnished silver. Phases
  of the moon are etched into its surface. _"Ever-changing, ever-knowing. Silver
  light protect us."_
- **Effect:** Touching it during a Full Moon grants ADV on next spellcasting
  check.

  **5. Sun Wheels**

- **Description:** A pair of enormous, toothed wheels of gleaming gold. _"Foe of
  the dark ones, banisher of evil."_
- **Effect:** Touching it at Zenith (Noon) grants a Luck Token.

  **8. Broken Eclipse Wheel (The Danger)**

- **Description:** A single, cracked wheel of obsidian. Its etchings show a disc
  moving across the sun by blotting it out. It is stuck on a day marking an
  active solar eclipse.
- **Inscription:** _"On this day, enemies of life itself pour forth from the
  obsidian temples."_
- **The Problem:** It is broken. Missing cogs (found in Area 2 with [[Maied]]).
- **The Choice:**
  1.  **Leave it:** It remains a warning.
  2.  **Fix it:** Inserting the cogs allows it to turn.
  - _Effect:_ Fixing it aligns the prophecy. It reveals the location of the
    **Temple of the Eclipse** (The Cult's true base).
  - _Risk:_ Touching it during an eclipse grants 1d8 Temp HP, but fixing it
    might alert the Cult (The "enemies pour forth" part).

    ***
- ## Conclusion

  **The Mission Complete:** If the party secures the **Star Map rubbings**
  (Area 6) and clears the threats (Panthers/Diplomacy with Treant), [[Captain Blackwood]] is
  satisfied.

  **[[Captain Blackwood]]'s Report:**

  > "The area is secured, Colonel. Though I must note the irregulars fraternized
  > with a sentient bush and refused to cull the local predators. Highly
  > unprofessional."

  **The Reward:** [[Colonel Huzzard]] grants the party the **Charter for Mivvin's
  Rest**. They are no longer squatters; they are Lairds.

  **Next Session:** The Star Map points to **Zuchotl** or the **Black Ziggurat**.
  The Army prepares to move out, but the "Wooden Rabbit" back at camp has started
  to hum...
