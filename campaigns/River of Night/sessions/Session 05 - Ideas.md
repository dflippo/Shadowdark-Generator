# Session 5 Brainstorming: The Consequences of Cowardice

## The "Catch-Up" Mechanism: The Ballad of the Absent Doctor

Since the player was missing for Sessions 3 and 4, the "in-canon" explanation is
that Doctor Googoo was hiding, sleeping, or inexplicably absent during the
crises. **The Minstrels** are the perfect vehicle to deliver this recap in a way
that reinforces the "Coward" reputation.

### New Lyrics (The Recap)

To the tune of "Brave, Brave Sir Robin":

> _"When the Jaguar came to feed, Doctor Googoo showed his speed!_ _Not to fight
> or save the lad, but to hide inside his pad!_ _He didn't save the Dwarf named
> Grimm, 'cause danger was too much for him!_ _And while the cultists killed and
> burned, Googoo's stomach simply turned!_ _Brave, Brave, Brave, Brave Doctor
> Googoo!"_

> _"He slept through screams and bloody fights, and ignored the jungle's biting
> mites!_ _While others walked the Serpent's Path, he stayed behind to take a
> bath!_ _The babies screamed, the father cried, but Googoo was safe inside!_
> _Brave, Brave, Brave, Brave Doctor Googoo!"_

## NPC Attitudes (The "Welcome" Back)

### Durgan Coalbeard (The Jaded Fan)

Durgan used to idolize Googoo. Now, he is bitter.

- **Interaction:** When Googoo appears, Durgan should be cleaning a weapon
  (maybe Grimm's pickaxe). He doesn't look up.
- **Dialogue:** "Oh. It's you. Surprised you came out. Figured the sun might be
  too loud for you."
- **Action:** If Googoo tries to give orders, Durgan ignores him or overtly asks
  another party member for confirmation. "Does the _Captain_ want that, or just
  the Jester?"

### Alan Quatermain (The Disappointed Commander)

Quatermain has moved past anger to cold pragmatism. He views Googoo as a
resource, not a person.

- **The Assignment:** "Doctor. You're alive. How... efficient of you to conserve
  your energy while my men died. Since you are so rested, you will take the
  First Watch tonight. Alone. In the dark. If you see anything, scream. It's
  what you're best at, after all."

## Plot Hooks for Session 5

### Idea 1: The Babysitter (Comedy/Horror)

The party kidnapped two **Baby Basilisks**. They are dangerous, hungry, and
magical.

- **The Task:** Quatermain assigns Doctor Googoo to be their "Caretaker" because
  no one else wants to do it.
- **The Challenge:** He has to feed them (they only eat fresh meat), keep them
  quiet (so the cult doesn't home in on them), and stop them from accidentally
  petrifying the staff.
- **The Twist:** The babies actually _like_ Googoo (maybe he smells like fear).
  They imprint on him. "Mama Googoo."

### Idea 2: The Siege Preps (Tactical)

The Cult is coming. Mivvin's Rest needs to be fortified.

- **The Task:** The party must prepare defenses. Traps, walls, organizing the
  militia.
- **Googoo's Role:** He is assigned as "Bait." The plan requires someone to
  stand out typically in the open to lure the initial scout party into a trap.
- **The Conflict:** Durgan volunteers Googoo for this role enthusiastically.

### Idea 3: The Parley (Social/Tension)

A messenger from the Cult arrives at the edge of the jungle.

- **The Message:** "Return the Stolen Ones (the babies), and we will only kill
  the adults. Keep them, and we kill everyone."
- **The Scene:** The party must decide. Quatermain wants to fight. Lady Johnson
  is terrified. The party must be the tie-breaker. Do they send Googoo to
  negotiate? He _is_ supposed to be a Doctor (man of science/letters).

## Recommended Session Flow

1.  **Opening:** The Minstrels wake Googoo up with the new recap song.
2.  **Social:** The "Walk of Shame" through the camp. Everyone glares. Durgan
    confronts him.
3.  **The Crisis:** The Baby Basilisks start causing trouble (escaping, eating
    chickens, turning a cat to stone).
4.  **The Climax:** The Cult's first wave / scouts attack or the Messenger
    arrives. The party must defend their new "pets" and their home.
