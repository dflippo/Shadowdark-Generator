## Introduction for the Game Master

This session begins with high-society intrigue and descends rapidly into total
chaos. The theme shifts from **Colonial Satire** to **Desperate Survival**.

**Key Elements:**

1.  **The Mystery:** Who poisoned [[Colonel Huzzard]]?
2.  **The Betrayal:** The [[Trojan Rabbit]] is a portal for the Cult.
3.  **The Boss Fight:** Maied returns, furious and powerful.

**Note on Weapons:** The Dominion Army uses **Heavy Crossbows** and
**Arbalests**. There is no gunpowder.

### [[Arbalest]]

A massive, steel-prod crossbow spanned with a mechanical windlass. It fires heavy iron bolts with armor-piercing force, effectively replacing muskets for the Dominion heavy infantry. They are slow to reload but devastating on impact.

---

## Part 1: The Grand Ball (The Calm)

**Scene:** The Governor’s Mansion. The main hall is unrecognizable. Tapestries
depicting the "Taming of the Wild" cover the moldy walls. In the corner,
**Doctor [[Doctor Googoo]]'s personal minstrels** (who he unfortunately paid in advance)
are providing the entertainment.

### Scene 1: The Gathering

_The party enters. The room is a sea of red uniforms and silk dresses. Colonel
Huzzard stands by a large punch bowl. As Doctor Googoo appears, the minstrels
strike up a jaunty, mocking tune:_

> "Brave Doctor Googoo ran away! (I didn't!) Bravely ran away away! When danger
> reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled! He saw a tree and
> shrieked in fright, And gallantly ran into the night! Brave, brave, brave,
> brave [[Doctor Googoo]]!"

_[[Colonel Huzzard]] looks flushed and victorious, ignoring the
lyrics._

**[[Lieutenant Sterling]]:** _(Approaching the party, holding a glass of
sherry)_ "Ah, the heroes of the hour! Look at you. You clean up well,
Considering where you've been. The Colonel is in high spirits tonight. He
believes the star map is the key to everything. Bringing civilization to this
godforsaken greenery."

**[[Major Ponsonby]]:** _(Lurking behind a pillar, nursing a cup of
water. He speaks in a low, scarred raspy voice)_ "Civilization? Is that what we
call it? Polished buttons and waltzes while the jungle rots your boots off your
feet. Huzzard’s a fool. He thinks drawing lines on a map makes the land ours. He
hasn't seen what lives in the dark. I have."

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** _(Materializing beside the party, notebook in hand)_
"Major Ponsonby, your cheerfulness is noted. And you, adventurers. I trust you
are prepared for the next phase? Once the Colonel announces the Charter, we
march for Zuchotl. No more wandering. No more... pets." _(He glares at Doctor
Googoo, if present)._

### Scene 2: The Toast & The Poison

_The music stops. [[Colonel Huzzard]] taps a spoon against his crystal goblet. The
room quiets._

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "Ladies, Gentlemen, Officers of the Dominion! _(He raises
his goblet high)_ Three months ago, this was a wilderness. A place of savagery
and superstition. Tonight? Tonight we drink from crystal in the Hall of
Governors! We have driven back the lizard-men! We have mapped the stars! We have
brought order to the chaos!"

_(Applause. [[Colonel Huzzard|Huzzard]] beams, sweat beading on his
forehead.)_

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "And to our special guests... the irregulars
who found the Star Map. I hereby grant you the Royal Charter for Mivvin's Rest!
You are no longer squatters. You are subjects of the Crown!"

_(He takes a deep, long draught of his wine. He swallows. He smiles. Then, his
eyes widen. He coughs—a wet, hacking sound.)_

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "I... I..." _(He clutches his throat. The
crystal goblet smashes on the floor. Purple foam bubbles at his lips.)_
"Treason... The wine... it burns..."

**[[Major Ponsonby]]:** _(Shouting, but not moving to help)_ "He's
down! The Colonel is down!"

**[[Lieutenant Sterling]]:** _(Freezing in panic)_ "Sir! Somebody help him! He's
choking!"

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** _(Calmly stepping back, watching the crowd)_ "Not
choking. Poison. Secure the exits. No one leaves."

### Scene 3: The Rush to the Font

_[[Colonel Huzzard|Huzzard]] collapses into the party's arms. He is
heavy, convulsing._

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** _(Gasping, clutching a PC's lapel)_ "Don't...
let them... see me... die."

**party Member (Medicine DC 12):** "It's Purple Lotus extract. He has seconds,
not minutes. The Font! Get him to the basement!"

_The party must drag him through the panicked crowd. Officers block their path._

**[[Lieutenant Sterling]]:** _(Blocking the door)_ "Where are you taking him?
This is a military matter! Surgeions only! You can't just drag the Commander
into a cellar!"

**[[Major Ponsonby]]:** _(Stepping in, hand on his sword hilt)_ "Let
them pass, boy! If he dies, he dies. If they can save him, let them try. Unless
you _want_ him dead, [[Lieutenant Sterling|Sterling]]?"

_They reach the basement. They dunk [[Colonel Huzzard|Huzzard]] into
the glowing Font of Healing. The purple foam dissolves. He gasps, inhaling huge
lungfuls of air._

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** _(Soaked, shivering, trembling with rage)_
"Who? Which one? [[Major "Mad Jack" Ponsonby|Ponsonby]] has wanted my rank for
years... [[Lieutenant Sterling|Sterling]] is impatient...
[[Captain Blackwood|Blackwood]] knows too much... _(He grabs the PC's arm)_ You.
You are the only ones outside this vipers' nest. Find them. Find the traitor.
Before they finish the job."

---

## Part 2: The Chaos Erupts (The Storm)

_Just as [[Colonel Huzzard]] catches his breath, a siren wails from the camp outside. It is
the distinct, rhythmic horn blast of the Dominion alarm._

**SOLDIER (Off-screen):** "BREACH! PERIMETER BREACH! TO THE BARRICADES!"

_A massive explosion rocks the house. Glass shatters._

**Read Aloud:**

> You rush to the veranda. The camp is in chaos. The [[Trojan Rabbit|"Wooden Rabbit"]]—that trophy
> dragged back from the jungle—is splitting apart. But it is not a machine. The
> wood twists and screams like living flesh. A swirling vortex of purple light
> tears open within its belly. From this rift, they pour out.
> [Cultists](cultist.md).
> Dozens of them. Screaming, chanting, throwing themselves at the Dominion
> lines.

**CULTIST LEADER:** _(Screaming over the din)_ "The Stone God Hungers! Break
their lines! Leave no stone atop another!"

**DOMINION SERGEANT:** "Form ranks! Arbalests, front! Load bolts! Volley fire on
my command! LOOSE!"

_The air fills with the hum of heavy crossbow strings. But the Cultists are
fast, and they are magically shielded._

---

## Part 3: The Wrath of Maied

_Just as the battle lines form, a deeper sound shakes the ground. A low, rolling
rumble that isn't an explosion. It's the earth moving._

**Read Aloud:**

> The treeline to the south explodes. It doesn't burn—it _bursts_. Massive trees
> are uprooted and tossed aside like twigs. Stepping from the jungle is a figure
> you know. [[Maied]]. But the flowers are gone. Her eyes burn with green, baleful
> fire. Her bark is black and spiked. She wields a staff the size of a sapling.

**MAIED:** _(Her voice is a grinding earthquake, booming across the clearing)_
"MURDERERS! FALSE KINGS!"

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** "Target left! Target left! Heavy bolt throwers, traverse!
Bring that thing down!"

**MAIED:** _(Raising her staff. Roots erupt from the ground, crushing a Dominion
ballista)_ "You take my land! You take my peace! And then... YOU TOOK MY
CHILDREN!"

**MAIED:** "Did you think the forest would forget? Did you think I would not
hear their screams? _(She points at the party)_ I smell their blood on you. The
blood of my kitties. You killed them. You left their cubs motherless and
fatherless. Now... THE JUNGLE CLAIMS YOU!"

### The Minions Attack: The Beast Tide

_Maied slams her staff. The jungle answers with a cacophony of roars, hisses,
and screeches._

**MAIED:** "Hunt them, my lovelies! Feast on their soft flesh! Leave no bone
unbroken!"

#### Wave 1: The Skybreakers

_From the canopy, a dark cloud descends. Not arrows, but living missiles.
Hundreds of gliding rodents and aggressive tropical birds dive-bomb the Dominion
arbalesters, aiming for eyes and throats._

**Venomous Flying Squirrel** _Small Beast, Neutral_ **AC:** 12 | **HP:** 4 |
**MV:** Near (Climb/Fly) **Attacks:** +2 Bite (1 dmg + Poison) **Special:**

- **Dive Bomb:** Attacks with Advantage if gliding from above.
- **Venom:** DC 10 CON check or become **Paralyzed** for 1 round ("The toxin
  stiffens the joints").

#### Wave 2: The Linebreakers

_The underbrush explodes. Massive, tusked
[boars](boar.md) the size of
ponies charge the Redcoat shield wall. The sound of impact is like a
thunderclap._

**Giant [Boar](boar.md)**
_Large Beast, Neutral_ **AC:** 13 (Thick Hide) | **HP:** 18 | **MV:** Double
Constant **Attacks:** +3 Tusks (1d8) **Special:**

- **Charge:** If moving at least Near before attacking, deal double damage
  (2d12).
- **Relentless:** When reduced to 0 HP, makes one final attack before dying.

#### Wave 3: The Silent Killers

_While the soldiers deal with the chaos, the true hunters emerge from the
shadows, stalking the ones who smell of panther blood—the Party._

**Viper
[Swarm](snake,_swarm.md)**
_Large Beast, Neutral_ **AC:** 10 | **HP:** 12 | **MV:** Near **Attacks:** +1
Bites (1d4 hits, 1 damage each) **Special:**

  ***

## Boss Encounter: [[Maied]], The Vengeful Mother

**Location:** The mud-churned clearing. Rain begins to fall. **The Situation:**
The Army is pinned by
[Cultists](cultist.md). The
Party must stop [[Maied]].

**Stats (Enhanced
[Dryad](dryad.md)):** **AC:**
16 (Ironbark) | **HP:** 65 | **MV:** Near (Burrow) **Attacks:** +4 Ironwood
Staff (1d8) or +4 Thorn Whip (1d6 + Pull to Close) **Special:**

- **Resistances:** Piercing, Bludgeoning, magical weapons (take half damage).
- **Vulnerabilities:** Fire, axes

### Scripted Combat Events

**Round 1: Entangle** _Maied strikes the earth with her staff. The mud boils.
Thick, knotty roots explode from the ground, seeking purchase on your ankles._
**MAIED:** "Hold still, little termites. Let the roots drink you dry. The soil
is hungry for your bones!"

- **Effect:** All PCs must make a **DC 12 DEX check**. On failure, they are
  **Stuck** (cannot move, attacks against them have Advantage). A DC 12 STR
  check is required to break free.

  **Round 2: Thorn Whip** _Maied extends a hand. Her fingers elongate into a
  dripping, thorn-covered vine that snaps like a whip towards the character who
  dealt the most damage._ **MAIED:** "Come here! Look into my eyes! Tell me... did
  they suffer? Did my beautiful panthers suffer when you butchered them?!"

- **Effect:** **+4 Attack vs AC**. On a hit, the target takes **1d6 damage** and
  is pulled to **Close** range with [[Maied]].

  **Round 3: Spore Cloud** _The flowers on Maied's shoulders wilt and rot in
  seconds, puffing out a cloud of choking yellow dust._ **MAIED:** "Breathe deep.
  The scent of decay. It is the only gift you deserve."

- **Effect:** All creatures within **Near** range must make a **DC 12 CON
  check**. On failure, they take **1d4 poison damage** and are **Blinded**
  (Disadvantage on attacks) for 1 round.

  **Reaction: Taking Fire Damage** **MAIED:** "AAAAH! Fire! The weapon of cowards!
  You burn what you cannot understand! You will burn in the end!"

  **Reaction: Taking Axe Damage** **MAIED:** "The bite of the iron... Augh! You
  hack and you hew... but the root remains! We always return!"

### Conclusion

**When Maied reaches 0 HP:** _She does not fall. She stiffens. Her movements
slow._

**MAIED:** _(Her voice becomes a whisper, sounding like rustling leaves)_ "My...
poor... babies... I... go... to... sleep... now..."

_She freezes. Her bark hardens. In seconds, she is a lifeless, twisted
[tree](treant.md) in the
center of the camp. Her face is frozen in a silent scream in the wood._

**LIEUTENANT STERLING:** _(Emerging from behind a crate, covered in mud)_ "Is...
is it dead? Good god. The size of it. We... we need to regroup. **LIEUTENANT
STERLING:** "Yes, sir! Medics! To the Colonel! 4th Platoon, secure that... that
tree! 5th Platoon, burn the corpses! We can't have them rising again!"

_The rain intensifies, washing the blood into the mud. The remaining soldiers
scramble, eyeing the frozen, screaming face of Maied with superstitious dread.
Dominion discipline is holding, but barely._

---

## Part 4: The Inquisitor's Tribunal

**Scene:** The Colonel's private study, miraculously untouched by the battle,
though the windows are shattered. **Atmosphere:** Tense, paranoid, and smelling
of ozone and wet wool.

_[[Colonel Huzzard]] sits behind his desk. He is wrapped in a blanket, his face
pale, but his eyes are sharp. He sips a cup of steaming herbal tea provided by
the Medic. [[Major Ponsonby]], [[Captain Blackwood]], [[Lieutenant Sterling]], and the Party
are present. The air is thick with suspicion._

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** _(Voice rasping, but steady)_ "The savage is dead. The
attack is repelled. But the war... the war is inside these walls. Someone in
this room, or someone commanded by a person in this room, put the Purple Lotus
in my cup."

**MAJOR PONSONBY:** _( leaning against the mantle, cleaning his nails with a
dagger)_ "Don't look at me, Huzzard. If I wanted you dead, I'd have called you
out for a duel like a gentleman. Poison is a woman's weapon. Or a coward's."

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** _(Scribbling furiously in his notebook)_ "Statistically,
the poison was administered between the 'Toast to Civilization' and the actual
drinking. Access was limited to the serving staff and the High Command. I
suggest we interrogate the steward."

**LIEUTENANT STERLING:** "The steward is dead, sir. A stray bolt during the
first volley. Convenient, isn't it?"

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** _(Slams his fist on the desk)_ "Enough! You," _(He points
to the Party)_ "You are outsiders. Mercenaries. You have no loyalty to the
politics of the Dominion, only to coin. Find me the truth. Tear this mansion
apart if you must. If you find the traitor, I will double your land grant. If
you fail... I will hang you all for negligence."

### Scene 1: The Investigation

_The party must investigate the mansion for clues. There are three key
locations:_

#### 1. The Kitchens

_The kitchen is a disaster zone. Pots are overturned, and sous-chefs are hiding
under tables._

**HEAD CHEF GASTON:** _(A nervous man with a formidable mustache, currently
trembling)_ "I saw nothing! Nothing! The wine was sealed! Vintage 89! I opened
it myself! Unless... the goblet? Who touched the goblet?"

- **Investigation Check (DC 12):** You find a small, distinct smear of purple
  powder on the inside of the velvet storage case for the Colonel's ceremonial
  goblet.
- **Perception Check (DC 14):** You spot a discarded pair of fine silk gloves in
  the waste bin. They smell faintly of almonds and lotus. They are embroidered
  with a specific crest: **A Silver Hawk.**

#### 2. The Serving Station

_Where the drinks were poured. A nervous young ensign is guarding the area._

**ENSIGN PIP:** "I didn't do it! I just carried the tray! But... I did see
someone loitering here before the speech. Someone high ranking. They said they
were 'inspecting the crystal for flaws'."

**Dialogue with [[Ensign Pip]]:**

- **PC:** "Who was it?"
- **Pip:** "I... I couldn't see their face clearly. The lighting was dim. But I
  heard their boots. Heavy. One foot dragged slightly. Click-drag. Click-drag."

#### 3. The Officer's Quarters

_The party searches the rooms of the three main suspects._

- **[[Lieutenant Sterling]]'s Room:** Immaculate. Letters to his mother about how much he
  admires Huzzard. _Not the killer._
- **Ponsonby's Room:** A mess. Empty whiskey bottles. A diary that says "Huzzard
  is a fool, but he pays well." _Not the killer._
- **[[Captain Blackwood]]'s Room:** Sparse. Mathematical charts. A locked chest (DC 15 to
  pick). Inside: A report to the "Home Office" detailing Huzzard's incompetence
  and a recommendation for "Immediate Replacement via Natural Causes."

### Scene 2: The Confrontation

_The party returns to the study. They must present their evidence._

**Evidence Points:**

1.  **The Boots:** "Click-drag" matches [[Captain Blackwood]], who has a prosthetic
    toe he never mentions.
2.  **The Gloves:** The Silver Hawk is the crest of the Intelligence
    Corps—[[Captain Blackwood]]'s unit.
3.  **The Report:** The letter in the chest is a smoking gun.

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "Well? Who is the snake in my garden?"

_If the Party accuses [[Captain Blackwood]] with evidence:_

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** _(He stops writing. He closes his notebook with a snap.
He adjusts his glasses.)_ "Efficient. I underestimated your observational
skills. I calculated a 14% chance of discovery."

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "Blackwood? You? After twenty years?"

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** "The Empire cannot afford sentiment, Colonel. You are
erratic. Emotional. This expedition is too important to be led by a man who
stops to make speeches while the jungle encroaches. The algorithm demanded your
removal."

_[[Captain Blackwood]] draws a hidden weapon—a prototype repeating hand-crossbow._

**[[Captain Blackwood]]:** "Regrettably, I must now purge the witnesses.
Calculations suggest I have a 60% chance of escape if I kill the nearest
mercenary and jump through the window."

**Combat:**

- **[[Captain Blackwood]]:** (Use
  [Thief](thief.md)/[Assassin](assassin.md)
  stats, but with a Repeating Hand Crossbow: 1d6 dmg, 2 attacks per round).
- He is quickly subdued by [[Major Ponsonby]] and [[Lieutenant Sterling]] if the party delays, but he
  should get one shot off at Huzzard (Misses) or a PC.

  ***

## Part 5: The March Begins

**Scene:** Dawn. The rain has stopped. The camp is battered but functional.
**[[Captain Blackwood]]** is in irons, being loaded onto a prisoner wagon.

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** _(Standing on the steps, looking healthier. The Font of
Healing works miracles.)_ "Take him away. He can explain his 'algorithms' to the
Hangman in the capital."

_He turns to the Party._

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "You have saved my life, and the soul of this expedition.
The Charter is yours. But the map... the map points to the heart of darkness.
Zuchotl."

**[[Major Ponsonby]]:** _(Spitting on the ground)_ "The men are ready, Colonel.
Scared, but ready. They saw that Tree-Witch die. They think we can kill gods
now."

**[[Lieutenant Sterling]]:** "The scouts report the Cultists have retreated to the
river. They are regrouping at the temple site."

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "Then we do not give them time. Strike the tents! Load the
wagons! Today, the Dominion marches to war!"

_Drams arise. Fifes play. The massive column of redcoats begins to move, winding
like a serpent of steel and wool into the deep green of the jungle._

**DOCTOR GOOGOO:** _(Popping out of a large, empty vase where he was hiding)_
"is it over? Did we win? I must say, I think my inspirational song really turned
the tide during the second wave! You're welcome, Colonel!"

**[[Colonel Huzzard]]:** "Someone get that goblin a uniform. If he's going to be
annoying, he can be annoying in the front lines."

**Narrator Close:**

> As the sun rises over the bruised canopy, the River of Night awaits. The
> "Jungle Strikes Back" was only the beginning. Now, the Empire strikes the
> heart.
>
> **Session End.**

## GM Notes for Next Session

1.  **Preparation:** The players now have a land grant (Mivvin's Rest is legally
    theirs), but they are conscripted as "Specialists" for the march on Zuchotl.
2.  **Travel:** The journey to Zuchotl will be a hex-crawl. Prepare random
    encounters for "Deep Jungle".
3.  **The Villain:** With Maied dead, the primary antagonist shifts to the
    **Cult of the Stone God** and their mysterious leader (hinted at in the
    [[Trojan Rabbit]] vortex).
4.  **Blackwood:** If he escaped, he is a recurring villain. If captured, he
    might escape later or offer information from his cell.
