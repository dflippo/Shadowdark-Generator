## Introduction for the Game Master

This session is designed to deepen the party's connection to their new patrons
and the grim realities of the world they've entered. Having been cured of her
jungle fever, a grateful [[Lady Johnson]] is ready to formally induct the characters
into her guild. However, the grizzled explorer [[Allan Quatermain]] believes they
need a true taste of the jungle's perils before they are worthy. He will lead
them on a "walkabout" that serves as an informal test, taking them to a place of
strange jungle magic and then to the site of a horrific tragedy that befell
another team of explorers.

This session will establish [[Allan Quatermain]] as a vital source of knowledge, showcase
the constant, ambient danger of the jungle, and foreshadow the looming threat of
the Basilisk Cult.

## Part 1: An Offer and a Test

### Atmosphere

The session begins the morning after the events of Session 1. The air in Johnson
Manor is still and heavy, but the oppressive sense of sickness has lifted.
Sunlight streams through the large windows of the study, illuminating dust motes
dancing over the myriad artifacts. The sounds of the jungle—the chirping of
unseen birds and the drone of insects—are a constant, low hum beyond the manor
walls.

### NPC Interaction

[[Lady Johnson]] is seated at her uncle's desk, looking vibrant and energetic, a
stark contrast to her previous state. [[Allan Quatermain]] stands near a window,
cleaning a large-caliber heavy crossbow, his expression as weathered and
unreadable as a river stone.

**Read the following to the players:**

> "[[Lady Johnson]] beams at you, her eyes sharp and clear. 'Thanks to you, I feel
> myself again. That miraculous water... it's a discovery for the ages! You've
> more than proven your resourcefulness. I would be honored to formally welcome
> you into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.'
>
> From the window, [[Allan Quatermain]] works a bolt into his heavy crossbow with a
> metallic clack. He doesn't look at you, his gaze fixed on the jungle's edge.
> 'They found a secret passage in a dusty library, Lara. This jungle chews up
> and spits out men who've faced far worse than a confused old ghost.'
>
> He turns, his eyes finally appraising you. 'The League isn't a social club.
> Membership is paid in sweat and blood. Before your names go in the charter, I
> want to see how you handle the Green Hell. A little walkabout. We leave in one
> hour.'"

[[Lady Johnson]] will defer to [[Allan Quatermain]]'s judgment, explaining that he is the
guild's foremost expert on jungle survival and his approval is essential. She
offers to resupply the party from the manor's stores (they can replenish
standard gear like torches, rations, rope, etc.).

[[Allan Quatermain]] will be curt and professional, offering no more details than
necessary. He expects them to be ready on the veranda in one hour.

## Part 2: The Walkabout

### Atmosphere

Once in the jungle, the oppressive heat and humidity return tenfold. The light
dims under the dense canopy, and the air is thick with the smells of damp earth,
blooming flowers, and decay. Quatermain moves with a quiet confidence, his heavy
crossbow held at a low ready. He points out tracks, identifies dangerous plants,
and occasionally stops, holding up a hand for silence as he listens to the
sounds of the jungle.

### Guided Encounters

[[Allan Quatermain]] leads the party south, deliberately taking them through areas of
interest to test their awareness and skills. This is less a hex-crawl and more a
guided tour of danger.

### Encounter 1: The Choking Vine

As you follow a barely-there trail, Quatermain suddenly stops and points with
his heavy crossbow bolt.

> "'Blood Vine,' he says, his voice a low whisper. 'Tough as iron wire. Senses
> warmth. Don't get close.'"

A thick, dark-red vine hangs in a coiled loop over the path ahead. A DC 12
Wisdom check reveals the faint outline of a skeletal macaque, its bones crushed
and tangled within a similar vine just off the path. The vine will lash out at
any warm-blooded creature that moves within a close distance of it.

**Trap: The Blood Vine**

- Attacks with advantage against any creature unaware of it.
- **Attack:** +5 to hit (contested Strength check). On a success, the target is
  grappled and pulled close to the tree trunk it hangs from.
- **Constrict:** At the start of the grappled creature's turn, it takes 1d8
  damage. It can attempt a DC 15 Strength check to break free.
- **Toughness:** The vine has an effective AC of 14 and can take 15 points of
  slashing damage before being severed. It is immune to piercing damage. Fire
  deals double damage to it.

  [[Allan Quatermain]] will not intervene unless a character is about to die, watching
  silently to see how they handle the threat. Success earns a curt nod.

### Encounter 2: The Gorilla Statue (Hex 603)

_Reference: Cursed Scroll 4 - River of Night V1-2, Hex 603_

After a few hours of travel, [[Allan Quatermain]] leads you into a sun-dappled clearing
dominated by an incredible sight.

> "A massive, stone statue of a gorilla, pocked with age and draped in moss,
> sits with its hands cupped as if offering a gift to the sky. The air here
> feels strangely peaceful, but the chattering and rustling in the surrounding
> trees suggest you are not alone."

A troop of 6 [Apes](ape.md)
are jealously guarding the statue. They will not attack immediately but will
hoot, beat their chests, and throw branches if the party approaches the statue.
They are not interested in a fight to the death, only in driving the party away.

**Challenge:**

- **Puzzle:** [[Allan Quatermain]] knows the secret of this place. He'll mutter, "The old
  ones believed in fair trade. A gift for a gift." If the players place a piece
  of fruit in the statue's hands, it will magically transform into a random
  potion.
- **Solution:** The players must find a way to distract or appease the apes to
  get to the statue. They might use food, intimidation (a successful DC 15
  Charisma check), or stealth. A clever use of magic could also work. If they
  simply attack, the apes will fight back for a few rounds before attempting to
  flee.
- **Reward:** Placing fruit in the cupped hands causes it to glow and reform
  into a Potion of Healing.

  **[Ape](ape.md) (6)**

- AC 12, HP 10, ATK 1 fist +2 (1d6) or 1 rock (far) +2 (1d4), MV near (climb), S
  +2, D +2, C +1, I -2, W +1, Ch +0, AL N, LV 2

## Part 3: The Slaughter at Dig Site A (Hex 104)

### Atmosphere

[[Allan Quatermain]] leads the party east from the statue, his demeanor growing more grim.
The jungle becomes quieter, the air heavier.

> "There's a dig site nearby I was meaning to check on. Run by a promising young
> fellow from Mivvin's Rest. Let's see if he's found anything more interesting
> than mud."

When you arrive, the scene is one of carnage. The camp has been utterly
destroyed. Tents are shredded, supplies are scattered, and the stench of blood
hangs heavy in the air. At least a dozen bodies of archaeologists and guards lie
where they fell.

### The Scene of the Crime

**Read the following as the players explore the site:**

> "The destruction is absolute. Bodies lie contorted on the ground, some pierced
> by what look like obsidian-tipped spears, others simply torn apart. But most
> disturbing are the fragments. You see the stony grey pieces of what must have
> once been human bodies—a shattered torso here, a hand frozen in a gesture of
> terror there. In the center of the camp is a 20-foot-deep excavation pit,
> where the stone roof of some buried structure emerges from the dirt."

### Investigation

- A DC 12 Intelligence check reveals that the attackers were brutally efficient.
  They struck fast and hard.
- A DC 12 Wisdom check allows a player to find a broken obsidian spearhead
  lodged in a wooden crate—it's of a style Quatermain recognizes.
- The shattered statues are the primary clue. A DC 15 Intelligence check on the
  fragments confirms this was petrification, and the damage was inflicted after
  the victims were turned to stone.
- Searching the main tent reveals a bloodstained journal. The last entry reads:

  > "Incredible! We've found it. A basilisk egg, perfectly preserved. It looks
  > like a stone veined with emerald. We've packed it for transport to Mivvin's
  > Rest for study. The local guides are terrified; they speak of a 'stone cult'
  > that worships the beasts. Superstitious nonsense."

### [[Allan Quatermain]]'s Insight

Once the clues are gathered, [[Allan Quatermain]] will piece it together, his voice low
and grim.

> "'Basilisk Cultists,' he spits, gesturing with his chin at the spearhead.
> 'Stone Warriors. They live deeper in the jungle. Worship the six-legged
> demons. Seems this lot found something the cult wanted back.' He looks at the
> shattered stone remains. 'And they brought one of their gods with them. This
> is what happens when you don't respect the Green Hell. This is the price of a
> moment's carelessness.'"

He confirms the egg was indeed sent back to Mivvin's Rest and is now secured in
the manor's vault. He hadn't realized its significance until now.

---

## Session Conclusion

The party returns to Mivvin's Rest, the grim reality of their new vocation
weighing heavily upon them. [[Allan Quatermain]] will lead them to the veranda and pour
them a stiff drink.

> "'You kept your heads. You learned. You survived.' He raises his glass in a
> short, sharp gesture. 'That's all the jungle asks. You're in.' He drains his
> glass. 'Welcome to the League.'"

[[Lady Johnson]] will greet them, her expression turning somber as Quatermain
explains what they found. She will confirm the basilisk egg is safe but is now
deeply concerned.

> "My God... they slaughtered them all for an egg? Allan, this cult... they're
> more than just savages." She turns to the party. "Your test is over, but it
> seems your first true mission has just found you. We have a nest of fanatics
> to deal with, and they now have a reason to turn their eyes toward this
> house."

**The session ends here.** The players are now full members of the League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen, they have the respect of [[Allan Quatermain]], and they
have a clear and present threat to confront in the coming sessions: the Basilisk
Cult from the temple at hex 706, who want their egg back.
