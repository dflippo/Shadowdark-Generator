**Class:** TBD  
**Level:** 3+  
**Status:** Active  
**League Status:** **Not a member** - Failed The Proving Ground

- ## Background

  Doctor Googoo is a member of the adventuring party exploring the Black River
  jungle. He came to Mivvin's Rest with the party after their adventures in
  Blackmire, where they defeated an ancient vampire.

- ## Personality

  _(Add character personality traits based on player portrayal)_

- ## Reputation & Relationships
- ### The Proving Ground Failure

  In [[Session 02 - The Proving Ground]], Doctor Googoo did not take the League
  entrance test seriously and **failed to gain membership** in the League of
  Extraordinary Gentlemen. This has had lasting consequences on his reputation.

- ### [[Allan Quatermain]] - Hostile

  [[Allan Quatermain]] greatly dislikes Doctor Googoo after his poor performance
  on The Proving Ground. Quatermain actively tries to come up with plans to
  eliminate him to help the other party members survive the jungle.

- ### [[Durgan Coalbeard]] - Hatred

  [[Durgan Coalbeard]] owes a life-debt to the party after they rescued him from a
  giant [panther](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/panther.md) in
  [[Session 03 - Teeth in the Night]]. However, because [[Grimm Ironfoot]] was
  killed by cultists during the same session, Durgan blames Doctor Googoo for not
  saving Grimm.

  **The Minstrel's Song:**

  Durgan organized a small group of minstrels to mock Doctor Googoo with a song
  (styled after "Brave Sir Robin" from Monty Python and the Holy Grail):

  > _"When the Jaguar came to feed, Doctor Googoo showed his speed!_  
  > _Not to fight it, understand, but to flee across the land!_  
  > _Brave, Brave, Brave, Brave Doctor Googoo!"_

  The minstrels were paid in advance and continue to perform this song, much to
  Doctor Googoo's embarrassment (see [[Session 05 - The Burden of Beasts]] and
  [[Session 07 - The Jungle Strikes Back]]).

- ## Character Development
- ### The Coward's Reputation

  Doctor Googoo has developed a reputation as someone who runs from danger rather
  than facing it. This started with The Proving Ground failure and was reinforced
  during the panther encounter.

- ### The Basilisk Bearer

  Despite his reputation, Doctor Googoo was entrusted (or burdened) with caring
  for the baby basilisks after the party kidnapped them. His attempt to flee with
  them led to further complications.

- ### Ongoing Mockery

  The combination of [[Durgan Coalbeard]]'s hatred, [[Allan Quatermain]]'s
  disdain, and the minstrels' songs creates a hostile social environment for
  Doctor Googoo at Mivvin's Rest.

- ## Equipment & Abilities

  _(Add character stats, equipment, and abilities as needed)_

- ## GM Notes

  Doctor Googoo serves as a source of comic relief and dramatic tension in the
  campaign. His failures and the consequences provide roleplay opportunities and
  complicate party dynamics.

  **Potential Development:**

- Redemption arc where he proves himself
- Continued failures leading to greater consequences
- Reconciliation with Durgan and/or Quatermain
- Finding his role in the party despite his reputation
