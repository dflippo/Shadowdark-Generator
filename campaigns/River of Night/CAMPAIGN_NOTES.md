# Campaign Notes - River of Night

## Session 1: The House on Mivvin's Rest

**What Actually Happened:**

The party was successful in session 1 defending against the Lizardfolk raiders.
They met Lady Johnson and Alan Quatermain. They were able to get past the globe
puzzle and they completed the ghost's star chart puzzle without fighting him.
They used the Font of Healing to cure Lady Johnson's jungle fever. They received
everything in The Reward section.

## Session 2: The Proving Ground

**What Actually Happened:**

The second session proceeded as planned. Doctor Googoo is the only party member
who was not welcomed into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen because he
didn't take the test seriously. As a result, Alan Quatermain greatly dislikes
Doctor Googoo and will try to come up with plans to eliminate him to help the
other player characters survive the jungle.

## Session 3: Teeth in the Night

**What Actually Happened:**

The party was successful in session 3 rescuing Durgan from the giant panther.
They were able to catch the panther and kill it. The then tried to carry the
panther back to Mivvin's Rest, but they were unable to. They were forced to
leave it behind and continue on their journey when they were returning and
smelled smoke from the burning of the camp at Mivvin's Rest. They fought one
basilisk cult leader and 8 cultists. They were able to kill the cult leader and
chose to save the house over the servants' quarters. Durgan swears a life-debt
to the party but because Grim Ironfoot was killed by the cultists, he blames
Doctor Googoo for not saving him. Doctor Googoo is now hated by Durgan and
Durgan has begun to taunt Doctor Googoo about his snoring. He has also organized
a small group of minstrels to sing about brave, brave Doctor Googoo and how he
ran away (the song sounds like Brave, Brave Sir Robin from Monty Python and the
Holy Grail).

## Session 4: The Serpent's Eye

**What Actually Happened:**

The party tracked the cult to their underground temple. During the mission, they
were forced to witness a harrowing ritual where a father sacrificed his younger
daughter to the Stone God, while his other child was taken as an acolyte. The
party also had to fight off vipers in a pit.

Despite the danger, the party chose to kidnap the two baby basilisks from the
hatchery. Quatermain was not amused, noting that if stealing an egg caused the
previous raids, stealing the young will bring the full force of the cult down
upon them. The cult is now expected to launch an all-out attack to wipe out
Mivvin's Rest.

## Session 5: The Burden of Beasts

**What Actually Happened:**

Doctor Googoo actually tried to run away with the baby basilisks. During the
confrontation, the party fought the Herald and his earth elementals. One of the
basilisks was taken by the Herald, who then misty stepped away with it.

## Session 6: The Albion Dominion

**What Actually Happened:**

The party successfully explored the temple and found all the celestial wheels.
They repaired the first wheel using the Heavy Brass Cogs obtained from Maied.
However, the story was adapted to reveal that the two parent panthers the party
killed were Maied's pets. When she later discovered this deed, the party was
forced to flee. They ultimately decided not to kill the panther cubs.
