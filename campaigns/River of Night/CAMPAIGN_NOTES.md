were able to get past the globe puzzle and they completed the

## Session 2: The Proving Ground

**Full Session Notes**: [[Session 02 - The Proving Ground]]  
**Journal Entry**: [[../../journals/2025_12_07]]

**What Actually Happened:**

The second session proceeded as planned. [[Doctor Googoo]] is the only party
member who was not welcomed into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen because
he didn't take the test seriously. As a result, [[Allan Quatermain]] greatly
dislikes [[Doctor Googoo]] and will try to come up with plans to eliminate him
to help the other player characters survive the jungle.

## Session 3: Teeth in the Night

**Full Session Notes**: [[Session 03 - Teeth in the Night]]  
**Journal Entry**: [[../../journals/2025_12_14]]

**What Actually Happened:**

The party was successful in session 3 rescuing [[Durgan Coalbeard]] from the
giant [panther](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/panther.md).
They were able to catch the panther and kill it. The then tried to carry the
panther back to Mivvin's Rest, but they were unable to. They were forced to
leave it behind and continue on their journey when they were returning and
smelled smoke from the burning of the camp at Mivvin's Rest. They fought one
[basilisk cult leader](npcs/basilisk-cult/cult-leader.md) and 8 cultists. They
were able to kill the cult leader and chose to save the house over the servants'
quarters. [[Durgan Coalbeard]] swears a life-debt to the party but because
[[Grimm Ironfoot]] was killed by the cultists, he blames [[Doctor Googoo]] for
not saving him. [[Doctor Googoo]] is now hated by [[Durgan Coalbeard]] and
[[Durgan Coalbeard|Durgan]] has begun to taunt [[Doctor Googoo]] about his
snoring. He has also organized a small group of minstrels to sing about brave,
brave [[Doctor Googoo]] and how he ran away (the song sounds like Brave, Brave
Sir Robin from Monty Python and the Holy Grail).

## Session 4: The Serpent's Eye

**Full Session Notes**: [[Session 04 - The Serpent's Eye]]  
**Journal Entry**: [[../../journals/2025_12_21]]

**What Actually Happened:**

The party tracked the [Basilisk Cult](npcs/basilisk-cult/) to their underground
temple. During the mission, they were forced to witness a harrowing ritual where
a father sacrificed his younger daughter to the Stone God, while his other child
was taken as an acolyte. The party also had to fight off
[vipers](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/snake,_viper.md) in a
pit.

Despite the danger, the party chose to kidnap the two baby
[basilisks](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/basilisk.md) from
the hatchery. [[Allan Quatermain|Quatermain]] was not amused, noting that if
stealing an egg caused the previous raids, stealing the young will bring the
full force of the cult down upon them. The cult is now expected to launch an
all-out attack to wipe out Mivvin's Rest.

[basilisks](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/basilisk.md).

[basilisks](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/basilisk.md) was

**Full Session Notes**: [[Session 06 - The Albion Dominion]]  
**Journal Entry**: [[../../journals/2026_01_11]]

**What Actually Happened:**

The party successfully explored the temple and found all the celestial wheels.

[[Maied]]. However, the story was adapted to reveal that the two parent
[panthers](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/panther.md) the
party killed were [[Maied]]'s pets. When she later discovered this deed, the
party was forced to flee. They ultimately decided not to kill the
