# Campaign Notes - River of Night

## Session 1: The House on Mivvin's Rest

**What Actually Happened:**

The party was successful in session 1 defending against the Lizardfolk raiders. They met Lady Johnson and Alan Quatermain. They were able to get past the globe puzzle and they completed the ghost's star chart puzzle without fighting him. They used the Font of Healing to cure Lady Johnson's jungle fever. They received everything in The Reward section.

## Session 2: The Proving Ground

**What Actually Happened:**

The second session proceeded as planned. Doctor Googoo is the only party member who was not welcomed into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen because he didn't take the test seriously. As a result, Alan Quatermain greatly dislikes Doctor Googoo and will try to come up with plans to eliminate him to help the other player characters survive the jungle.
