- ## Introduction for the Game Master

  This session serves two purposes: reintegrating the absent player (Doctor
  Googoo) into the narrative and setting the stakes for the upcoming war. The tone
  shifts from high-adventure exploration to a mix of **social tension** and
  **black comedy** as the party deals with the consequences of their "loot."

  **Theme:** Responsibilty and Resentment.

  **Shadowdark Mechanics:**

- **Reaction Rolls:** NPCs are hostile or unfriendly to Doctor Googoo.
- **Animal Handling:** The baby basilisks are a complex hazard/resource.
- **Fortification:** The party can spend resources/time to gain bonuses for the
  future siege.

  ***

- ## Part 1: The Walk of Shame
- ### Atmosphere

  The session begins immediately in the morning. The air is heavy, humid, and
  smells faintly of acrid smoke—a lingering reminder of the burnt servants'
  quarters. The usual cheerful bustle of Mivvin's Rest is gone. Instead, there is
  only the grim sound of hammers on wood and the rasp of whetstones.

  **The Wake-Up Call:** Doctor Googoo wakes up not to a rooster, but to the
  strumming of a lute right outside his tent flap.

  **The Song of the Absent Doctor:** (Sing to the tune of "Brave, Brave Sir Robin"
  from _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_)

  > _"When the Jaguar came to feed, Doctor Googoo showed his speed!_ _Not to fight
  > or save the lad, but to hide inside his pad!_ _He didn't save the Dwarf named
  > Grimm, 'cause danger was too much for him!_ _And while the cultists killed and
  > burned, [[Doctor Googoo]]'s stomach simply turned!_ _Brave, Brave, Brave, Brave Doctor
  > Googoo!"_
  >
  > _"He slept through screams and bloody fights, and ignored the jungle's biting
  > mites!_ _While others walked the Serpent's Path, he stayed behind to take a
  > bath!_ _The babies screamed, the father cried, but Googoo was safe inside!_
  > _Brave, Brave, Brave, Brave Doctor Googoo!"_

- ### The Kitchen Confrontation

  Hungry and perhaps hoping to ignore the song, Googoo heads to the field kitchen
  for coffee.

- **The Cook:** A large, usually jovial woman named **[[Martha]]**. Today, she slams
  a metal ladle onto the table as he approaches.
- **[[Martha]]:** "No."
- **Googoo:** (If he asks why)
- **[[Martha]]:** "Coffee is for the workers. For the people building the walls to
  keep us safe. Not for..." She waves the ladle vaguely at him. "Not for
  guests."
- **The Insult:** She deliberately pours the last of the fresh pot into the
  dirt, maintaining eye contact. "Looks like we're out. Shame."
- ### The Realization ([[Durgan Coalbeard]])

  Walking away from the kitchen, [[Doctor Googoo]] finds **[[Durgan Coalbeard]]** sitting on a
  crate near the blackened ruins of the bunkhouse. He is sharpening a massive,
  heavy pickaxe—**[[Grimm Ironfoot]]’s pickaxe**. The sound is rhythmic and harsh:
  _Shhhk. Shhhk. Shhhk._

  He looks older. His face is smeared with soot and sweat, and his eyes are
  red-rimmed. He doesn't look up when Googoo approaches.

  > **Durgan:** "Don't mind the noise, Doctor. Just sharpening Grimm's axe."
  >
  > _He pauses, dragging his thumb lightly across the blade to test the edge. A
  > bead of blood appears._
  >
  > **Durgan:** "Someone has to do his work now. Since he's... gone."
  >
  > _He finally looks up. His expression isn't angry—it's disappointed. Broken._
  >
  > **Durgan:** "They say he died screaming for help. Trapped under a burning
  > beam. I tried to pull him out, but I wasn't strong enough. kept thinking...
  > 'Where are the heroes? Where's the magic?'"
  >
  > _He spits on the ground near [[Doctor Googoo]]'s feet._
  >
  > **Durgan:** "But you were sleeping, weren't you? Dreaming of brave deeds, no
  > doubt. Stay out of my way, Doctor. I have a grave to dig before sunset."

  ***

- ## Part 2: The Assignment

  Quatermain summons the party to the main veranda. He stands behind a large
  table, looking at a map of the compound. Two iron cages sit on the table,
  covered by heavy canvas. Hisses, clicks, and the smell of sulfur emanate from
  them.

  > **Quatermain:** "You're finally awake. How... convenient."
  >
  > _He gestures to the cages._
  >
  > **Quatermain:** "We have a problem. You brought these... things... into my
  > house. They are dangerous. They are loud. And they are hungry."
  >
  > _He rips the canvas off._

  **The Reveal:** Inside are the two **Baby
  [Basilisks](../../shadowdark-library/monsters/manual-monsters/basilisk.md)**
  (Iggy and Pop). They are the size of large dogs, with scales the color of dried
  blood and eyes that glow with a faint, sickly pale light. They hiss at the
  sudden light, snapping their jaws against the iron bars. One of them spits a
  glob of acid that sizzles on the polished mahogany table.

  > **Quatermain:** "I cannot have my men distracted by them. And I certainly
  > won't feed them. But..."
  >
  > _He turns to look at Doctor Googoo, a cruel, thin smile forming on his lips._
  >
  > **Quatermain:** "We have one prospective member of the League who seems to
  > have an abundance of free time. And energy. Doctor, step forward."

  **The Contract:** Quatermain slides a piece of paper across the table. It is
  hand-written, the ink still wet.

  > **Quatermain:** "Sign this. It is a liability waiver. It states that any
  > damage to property, livestock, or personnel caused by these creatures is
  > deducted directly from your share of any future rewards. And if the cost
  > exceeds your share... well, we have debtor's prisons in the nearestcity."

  **The Task:**

  > **Quatermain:** "You are hereby appointed 'Head Beastmaster.' You will feed
  > them. You will clean them. You will keep them quiet. If they escape, it is
  > your fault. If they turn anyone to stone, it is your fault. And if they die...
  > well, they are our only leverage against the Cult, so do try not to kill
  > them."
  >
  > _He tosses a heavy ring of keys to Googoo._
  >
  > **Quatermain:** "Congratulations, Doctor. You are now a father. Try not to
  > disappoint them as you have us."

  ***

- ## Part 3: The Great Barricade (The Montage)

  While Doctor Googoo is shackled with his new charges, Quatermain orders the
  construction of a massive barricade to encircle the main compound.

  > **Quatermain:** "The jungle is too open. If they come in force, they'll swarm
  > us. We need a funnel. We need a kill box. We need a wall."

  The party must coordinate the servants and laborers in a frantic effort to fell
  trees, stack heavy furniture, dig trenches, and pile sandbags. This is a montage
  sequence where each party member (except Googoo) contributes.

  **Scene A: The Heavy Lifting (Strength)** Durgan drags out a crate of heavy
  mining tools—**pickaxes**, sledgehammers, and shovels—left behind by the dwarven
  crew.

  > **Durgan:** "Grab a pick! If it can break rock, it can break ground! Put your
  > backs into it, you soft-skinned surface dwellers!"

- **Action:** The party must help clear the line of sight. Chopping down ancient
  palms, dragging heavy ironwood trunks.
- **Check:** DC 12 STR. _Success:_ The base of the wall is solid ironwood.
  _Failure:_ A tree falls the wrong way, crushing a supply crate.

  **Scene B: The Reinforcements (Intelligence/Engineering)** The wall needs mass.
  [[Lady Johnson]] reluctantly allows the use of the mansion's furniture.

- **Action:** Hauling heavy oak wardrobes, dining tables, and bookshelves to
  reinforce the weak points of the fence.
- **Check:** DC 12 INT. _Success:_ The furniture is interlocked perfectly,
  creating a dense barrier. _Failure:_ A gap remains that a goblin (or cultist)
  could squeeze through.

  **Scene C: The Accident (Dexterity/Wisdom)** Suddenly, a shout goes up. A rope
  snaps! A massive log swings wildly toward a group of terrified maids carrying
  water.

- **Action:** A player must intervene! Tackle the maid, catch the rope, or brace
  the log.
- **Check:** DC 14 DEX save. _Success:_ You save them. The servants look at you
  with awe. _Failure:_ You take 1d6 damage, and the servants are shaken (Morale
  penalty).

  **The Result:** By sunset, the wall is built. It is ugly—a chaotic scar of wood,
  earth, and antiques—but it looks strong.

  > **Quatermain:** "It's not pretty. But it will turn a blade. Good work,
  > gentlemen. Now pray we don't need it."

  ***

- ## Part 4: Nursery Crimes (Doctor Googoo)

  Simultaneously, Googoo is dealing with a nightmare in the stables.

  **The Basilisks (Iggy and Pop):** They are bored. They are hungry. They are
  teething.

- **Iggy:** The smaller one. Loves to chew on metal. Keeps trying to eat the key
  ring on [[Doctor Googoo]]'s belt.
- **Pop:** The larger one. Aggressive. Hisses at anything that moves.

  **The Heist (Getting Food):** The babies start shrieking. A high-pitched,
  oscillating wail that hurts the teeth.

  > **Quatermain (shouting from the roof):** "Silence those beasts, Doctor, or I
  > will silence YOU!"

  [[Doctor Googoo]] needs meat. But [[Martha]] the Cook has banned him from the kitchen.

- **Mission:** Sneak into the pantry and steal a raw roast beef or a string of
  sausages.
- **Obstacle:** [[Martha]] is sharpening a cleaver. The door squeaks.
- **Check:** DC 12 DEX (Stealth). _Failure:_ [[Martha]] spots him. He has to flee
  with a cloud of flour in his face, perhaps grabbing only a bag of dried jerky
  (which the babies hate).

  **The Escape (The Cat Incident):** While Googoo is feeding them (or wiping flour
  off his face), "Iggy" bites his finger and scuttles out of the cage.

  **Read Aloud:**

  > "The creature is fast—impossibly fast. It skitters across the floorboards with
  > a sound like rain on a tin roof, heading straight for the open door and the
  > garden beyond.
  >
  > And right in its path, sunning herself on a warm stone, is 'Duchess'—Lady
  > Johnson's prize-winning, very fluffy, very beloved Persian cat."

  **The Chase:**

- **Round 1:** Iggy corners the cat. Duchess hisses. Iggy's eyes begin to glow
  brighter.
- **Round 2:** Duchess swipes! Iggy hisses back!
- **The Goal:** Catch the baby BEFORE it turns the cat to stone.
- **Mechanic:** Skill Challenge (4 Successes needed).
  - _Stealth (DEX):_ To sneak up without startling it.
  - _Athletics (STR):_ To dive and grab it.
  - _Animal Handling (WIS):_ To calm it down with cooing noises.
  - _Failure:_ Duchess becomes a statue. [[Lady Johnson]] screams from the balcony.
    (Consequence: Shop prices triple, and she refuses to heal Googoo).
  - _Success:_ Googoo catches it just in time. The baby nuzzles into his chest,
    spitting a little acid on his coat. It looks up at him and chirps, "Mama?"

    ***
- ## Part 5: The Parley

  As the sun sets, coloring the jungle in bruised purples and reds, the frantic
  work on the barricade ceases. A silence falls over the jungle—not the quiet of
  sleep, but the holding of breath.

  Then, a single horn blast shatters the air. Deep, resonant, and sounding like
  shifting tectonic plates.

  **Read Aloud:**

  > "The jungle foliage at the edge of the clearing withers and parts. A tall
  > figure steps into the twilight, masked in beaten gold that reflects the dying
  > sun. He wears robes of woven jaguar pelt and carries a staff topped with a
  > screaming human skull.
  >
  > But the air grows cold because of what walks behind him. Four massive figures
  > heavily trudge out of the tree line. They are roughly humanoid, but made of
  > gray, moss-slicked boulders held together by thick vines and dark magic.
  >
  > **'Stone-Walkers,'** Durgan whispers, the color draining from his face. He
  > grips his pickaxe until his knuckles are white. 'Living rock. The earth itself
  > coming to kill us.'"

  **The Emissary:** The Herald stops twenty paces from your new wall. He tilts his
  head, the gold mask betraying no emotion, though his voice booms with an
  unnatural, grinding resonance.

  > **Herald:** "You build walls of twig and dirt against the slide of the
  > mountain? How... adorable."
  >
  > _He spreads his arms, and the ground trembles slightly._
  >
  > **Herald:** "We do not seek to spill blood needlessly this night! The Stone
  > God is stern, but fair. We seek only the return of what is ours!"
  >
  > _He points the skull-staff directly at the mansion._
  >
  > **Herald:** "You have stolen the Children of the Earth. The Divine hatchlings.
  > Return them to us now, unharmed. And with them, deliver the heads of the
  > thieves who dared desecrate the Holy Site of the Serpent's Eye."
  >
  > **Herald:** "Look at your defenses. Look at your trembling servants. Do you
  > think they can save you? Give us the beasts and the thieves, and Mivvin's Rest
  > shall be spared. Refuse... and we will grind this house into dust and sow the
  > earth with salt."

  **The Negotiation:** The party has a moment to respond.

- **Quatermain:** Is leveling his crossbow, waiting for the order. "I can take
  him, but not the big ones."
- **[[Lady Johnson]]:** "Don't you dare give them those babies! If we give in now,
  they'll just kill us later!"
- **[[Doctor Googoo]]'s Choice:** The Herald seems to sniff the air. "I smell them... the
  Mother-Scent is on one of you. Step forward, false-mother!"

  ***

- ## Part 6: The Breach

  If/When the negotiation fails (or if the party attacks):

  > **Herald:** "So be it. You choose death. The Stone God accepts your
  > sacrifice."

  **The Spell of Unbinding:** The Herald raises his staff high. The human skull
  atop it doesn't just sit there—its jaw unhinges, and it lets out a shriek that
  sounds like grinding metal. The Herald begins to chant in a language that makes
  your teeth ache (Primordial/Terran).

  > **Herald:** _"Osh-Kroth! Bala-Kroth! The marrow calls to the stone!"_

  **The Effect:**
  1.  **The Earth Heaves:** The ground beneath your feet ripples like water. The
      carefully dug trenches of your barricade simply fold in on themselves,
      destabilizing the party before the first blow is struck. (All players must
      make a **DC 12 DEX save remaining standing**).
  2.  **The Call of the Blood:** Inside their cages (or wherever Googoo has them),
      **Iggy and Pop go berserk**. Their eyes flare with blinding white light, and
      they begin to shriek in harmony with the staff. They are trying to answer
      the call.
  - _Plot Twist:_ The Herald isn't just attacking; he is actively
    _controlling_ the babies. If he gets close enough, they might turn on the
    party.

    _He slams the butt of his staff into the earth. A visible shockwave of green
    force ripples through the grass._

    > **Herald:** "Walk, brothers! Walk and crush the insects!"

    **The Surprise:** The party watches from behind their newly constructed
    barricade—the one they spent all day building. They grip their weapons,
    confident that the wall of massive logs, sandbags, and reinforced furniture will
    channel the enemy.

    It doesn't.

    **Read Aloud:**

    > "The lead Stone-Walker does not slow down. Empowered by the Herald's magic,
    > its rocky hide glows with runic energy. It simply walks _through_ the wall.
    >
    > With a thunderous _CRACK_ that sounds like a cannon shot, the massive ironwood
    > trunk shatters into splinters. The heavy oak wardrobe you dragged out is
    > flattened like a matchbox. The 'impregnable' barricade offers less resistance
    > than wet paper.
    >
    > Dust billows up, and through the cloud, the Golems keep marching. _Thud. Thud.
    > Thud._ Unstoppable. Unfeeling. Inevitable."

    ***

- ## Part 7: The Skirmish (The Siege)

  **Objective 1:** The outer defenses are gone in an instant. The party must
  retreat and hold the _inner_ gate (the Veranda) for **5 rounds** until
  Quatermain can ready the heavy ballista on the roof.

  **Objective 2 (Secondary): Contain the Beasts.** Iggy and Pop are trying to
  break out. Every round, the "Keeper" (likely Googoo) must make a **DC 12 WIS
  (Animal Handling)** or **STR (Athletics)** check to keep them contained.

- _Failure:_ One of the babies breaks loose and runs toward the Herald.
- _Consequence:_ If a baby reaches the Herald, he teleports away with it
  (Mission Failure for that beast).

  **Tactical Note:** The Stone-Walkers are resistant to almost everything _except_
  heavy bludgeoning damage.

- **Resistance:** Arrows bounce off harmlessly. Swords chip against the stone.
- **Vulnerability:** **The Pickaxes.** This is the payoff. Players (or Durgan)
  using the mining tools deal double damage.

  **Enemy Roster:**

- **4 Stone-Walkers:** AC 16, HP 30, Moves Near (Slow).
  - _Attack:_ Slam +4 (1d8+2). If hit, target must succeed DC 12 STR or be
    knocked prone.
- **The Herald:** Stays back.
  - _Action:_ **Beckon Beast.** Uses his action to magically pull the babies
    closer (giving Disadvantage on the Keeper's check).
  - _Spells:_ Can cast _Bane_ or _Command_ ("Drop the cage!") if threatened.

    **Round-by-Round Drama:**

    **Round 1: The Panic** The servants scream and flee as the Golems step onto the
    lawn.
- Quatermain shouts from the roof: "The winch is stuck! Buy me time! Hold them
  back!"
- The Golems advance.

  **Round 2: The Clash** The Golems reach the party.

- Durgan charges the lead Golem with a roar, swinging Grimm's pickaxe. _CRACK!_
  A massive chunk of stone flies off the Golem's shoulder.
- "Use the picks!" he screams. "Crack the shell!"

  **Round 3: The Magic** The Herald casts _Earth Tremor_. The ground shakes.

- All players must make a DC 12 DEX save or fall prone.
- Prone players are vulnerable to the Golems' heavy slam attacks.

  **Round 4: The Crisis** One of the Golems bypasses the party and tears a pillar
  off the veranda. The roof groans.

- [[Lady Johnson]] fires her crossbow, but the bolt shatters against the stone
  chest. "It's not working!"
- A player must distract this Golem or the roof collapses (potentially pinning
  Quatermain).

  **Round 5: The Thunder** Quatermain screams: "CLEAR THE LINE! GET DOWN!"

- The heavy ballista twangs—a sound like a giant guitar string snapping.
- **Read Aloud:** "A massive iron bolt, the size of a spear, screams through the
  air. It strikes the lead Golem center-mass. There is a deafening explosion of
  stone and dust. The Golem doesn't just fall—it disintegrates."
- ## Conclusion

  With the lead Golem shattered and the others taking heavy damage from the
  pickaxes, the Herald realizes the "soft-skins" have fangs.

  > **Herald:** "The Stone endures! But the night is long!"
  >
  > _He casts a smoke bomb (or dust cloud) and retreats into the jungle. The
  > remaining slow Golems turn to cover his escape, but eventually crumble into
  > inanimate piles of rock._

  **Durgan's Reaction:** He is panting, leaning on his pickaxe. He looks at the
  shattered remains of a Stone-Walker. He looks at Googoo.

  > **Durgan:** "They can make soldiers out of rocks? We're gonna need a bigger
  > hammer."

  **Next Session:** The Siege of Mivvin's Rest (The Main Army Arrives).
