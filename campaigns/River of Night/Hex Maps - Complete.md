- ## Complete Hex Descriptions
- ### 002. TECUHAN

  A white-haired gorilla named Tecuhan lives with his pet jaguar (panther), Siroc, in a secluded grove rich with fruit trees. Dozens of bone-carved wind chimes and flutes hang from the branches. Tecuhan is intelligent and speaks wisely, preferring to ask questions rather than answer directly. However, he refuses to converse with those who do not bring him an offering of goat's milk.

  **Quest:** His gorilla-wife, Rokara, went missing a year ago after traveling to a camp of explorers in need (812) to advise them and offer healing. Tecuhan gives his **Staff of Healing** to anyone who brings him Rokara's gold arm band and news of her fate.

  ***

- ### 006. AZARUMMIANS

  A vast sinkhole hides a village of 200 souls that has dwelt for centuries in darkness. These pallid, wolfish humans call themselves Azarummians rather than Itzalca, and they speak with the dialect of an ancient time. Stone huts cluster around groves of sun-starved derket-fruit trees; they alone can eat the fruit without being poisoned. They braid the fruit's skin into meager candles that serve as their only source of light.

  **Leader:** Bretuli - blind, sharp-toothed man who forbids discussion of the surface.

  **Belief:** The Azarummians believe one day their "Pale Queen" will return to lead them to conquest over the world above, and that she sleeps deep within the haunted underworld. Warriors have sought her in the tunnels that stretch endlessly down, but few have returned. Those who do are regarded as heroes and may ritualistically sharpen their teeth as a display of honor.

  **Historical Note:** Over 1,000 years ago, the Pale Queen led Azarummian warriors against Zuchotl (921).

  ***

- ### 104. DIG SITE A

  Scuttled campsites surround a 20' deep excavation pit. Inside, the peak of a stone roof emerges from the dirt. A faded wood sign says "Dig suspended until further notice. Return to base camp at Mivvin's Rest."

  ***

- ### 120. LAVA TUBES

  A field of jagged holes pocks the blackened earth before a lake of churning lava. Some are large enough for an elephant to enter. These tunnels emerge at the base of the volcano Tsibalba (122), but there's a 3:6 chance of encountering a group of 2d6 salamanders traveling in the opposite direction.

  ***

- ### 122. TSIBALBA\*

  This trembling volcano spits streamers of lava up into the sky day and night. A tribe of fiery lizardfolk (salamanders) called the Skirrim resides here, unfazed by the torturous heat. They dwell in a temple ruled by a revered elder. The Skirrim guard the temple with their lives, especially the iron +1 longbow called Rothak that ignites arrows to deal +1d4 damage.

  **See:** [Tsibalba.md](dungeons/Tsibalba.md) for complete dungeon details.

  ***

- ### 201. BASILISK CULT\*

  A moss and vine-draped temple leers silently out of the jungle. Within, a fading sect of 20 stone warriors nurture their four basilisk hatchlings and an aging adult basilisk. Their leader, the stone shaman Mictza, plots to raid Dig Site A (104) for captives once the archaeologists return.

  **See:** [Basilisk Cult.md](dungeons/Basilisk%20Cult.md) for complete dungeon details.

  **Note:** This is separate from hex 706 (Uzaru's cult temple).

  ***

- ### 209. CURSED PILLARS

  Six stone pillars surround a perfectly smooth reflecting pool. Dozens of niches in the pillars each contain a soapstone statuette of a crouching, shapeless human. At night, these statuettes animate and clamber down to perform their nightly ritual of drowning themselves in the pool. They rise once more at dawn and return to their niches.

  **Curse:** Anyone who disturbs a statuette during the day is cursed to take its place in the nightly ritual unless they return the statuette to its niche before nightfall.

  ***

- ### 213. BLACK SEED\*

  A glossy black obelisk towers above the jungle canopy like a crooked finger pointing at the sky. This alien structure is composed of an unknown metal-like material that is silky to the touch. Its surface opens into an entrance during a solar eclipse. Inside, an army of void beings dwells in hibernation tanks, waiting for the eclipse to release them into the world.

  **Guardians:** The villagers of Utzimatu (215) view it as their duty to stop people from meddling with it.

  **See:** [Black Seed.md](dungeons/Black%20Seed.md) for complete dungeon details.

  ***

- ### 215. UTZIMATU

  This village stands along the Black River in the shadow of the mountains. Brightly painted stone buildings rise on tiered mounds of earth. Here, 400 Itzalca farmers and fishers are led by Tezoticali, a resolute warrior-priestess who worships Oatali the Rainbow Snake.

  **Conflict:** She holds fierce enmity toward the basilisk cultists (706) who took her young son, Yasitli, as tribute a year ago.

  **Mission:** The villagers view it as their duty to stop people from meddling with the Black Seed (213).

  **Recent Event:** Tezoticali recently called upon Oatali to prevent nearby explorers (812) from entering the mountains; her god sent a giant anaconda to the camp in reply.

  ***

- ### 311. DIG SITE B

  20 archaeologists from Mivvin's Rest (803) conduct a dig here. The head of the team, a bookish young man named Laurencio, is thrilled and terrified at the recent unearthing of six coffins carved with scorpions. He awaits further orders, but his lovestruck colleague, Amelia, secretly plans to open the coffins to impress him.

  **Danger:** **6 vampire spawn** lie inside the coffins.

  ***

- ### 508. KURIMBU

  A goliath, red-tailed giant catfish called Kurimbu dwells in the rich mud here. It sometimes mistakes passing boats as fish (3:6 chance) and tries to swallow them, but retreats if injured.

  ***

- ### 514. BLACK ZIGGURAT\*

  A black, lightless ziggurat rises from the earth like a stark monument. Its sharp angles and metallic material are wholly unnatural. Deep within, a nexus of energy serves as a mighty source of power to beings from the void. A creature from this dimension who touches it is transformed into an utterly alien horror. Only the intervention of a deific being of great power could subvert this process, and even then, not fully.

  **See:** [Black Ziggurat.md](dungeons/Black%20Ziggurat.md) for complete dungeon details.

  ***

- ### 520. DIG SITE C

  Marigold, a hard-bitten jungle explorer and scientist, heads this tidy and efficient camp of 30 people. Her sister, Grenne (803), instructed her to find and study viperian-age relics. She does not realize how dangerously close she is to the last remaining viperian stronghold (621).

  ***

- ### 603. GORILLA STATUE

  A chipped and age-pocked statue of a large gorilla sits with its hands cupped. Once per day, placing a piece of fruit in its hands turns the fruit into a random magic potion.

  ***

- ### 616. FROG TREE

  A broad-leaved, dewy tree grows in the center of a secluded grove filled with blue butterflies. The jungle's only population of blue dart frogs lives on its branches. A wizened druid called Cuzol guards the frogs with his life, as did his mother before and as will his son. Only one worthy of the frogs' judgment may touch them. Frogs removed from the grove swiftly wither and die.

  ***

- ### 621. VIPERIAN CITADEL

  Soaring walls of jade-green stone are capped in glittering gold domes. Grandiose pillars and arches give the impression of many windows and entrances, but there is only one way in — a towering door guarded by two enormous cobra statues. These statues animate to strike any whose intentions are hostile toward the 600 viperians within.

  **History:** This stronghold is the last vestige of a once-great empire that ruled earth before mankind. The remaining viperians are deeply bitter and secretive.

  **Rulers:** An enclave of four ageless viperian wizards rule; they jealously guard their ancient knowledge and plot against each other.

  ***

- ### 706. BASILISK CULT\*

  A crumbling temple of water-stained stone and erupting vines. Within, a venerable (yet spry) stone shaman called Uzaru commands 20 stone warriors and three basilisk hatchlings. Eight stone warriors have been spying on Mivvin's Rest (803) and will soon launch an attack to steal the basilisk egg the archaeologists dug up.

  **See:** [Basilisk Cult.md](dungeons/Basilisk%20Cult.md) for complete dungeon details.

  **Note:** This is separate from hex 201 (Mictza's cult temple). **The party has NOT been to this location** - they cleared a different temple.

  ***

- ### 711. DISEASED JAVELINAS

  A herd of 25 diseased javelinas runs rampant through a marshy lowland south of the Black River. They carry a disease that causes black blood to run from their noses and ears and makes them uncharacteristically aggressive.

  **Discovery:** These miniature boars nest around the wreck of a sailboat-sized, obsidian vessel buried in the bog. A jagged hole mars its perfectly smooth, arrowhead-shaped exterior.

  ***

- ### 716. TIWARA

  A village of 300 Itzalca live in elevated huts along the river. They boast the only canoe makers in the region, but their most expert craftsman, Hiromandus, has been taken captive by the Bloodspear lizardfolk (1220). Canoe production has ground to a halt without him.

  **Leader:** Okahara - a gentle fisherman. Unknown to all, he was raised as a basilisk cultist and fled the temple (201) ten years ago. The cultists hold a bitter grudge toward him and would be willing to trade almost anything for his return.

  ***

- ### 803. MIVVIN'S REST

  **PARTY BASE CAMP**

  Grenne Reskin, a spry and curious old woman, heads up the 40-person base camp for archaeological digs along the Black River. The oppressively hot jungle presses in thickly around the khaki tents and campfire pits. Grenne has been here for years and knows a great deal about the dangers of the Tal-Yool jungle. She tuts and fusses about the safety of her always-rotating staff of young scholars.

  **Current Threat:** Recently, nearby basilisk cultists (706) have been spying on the camp and are planning an ambush to steal the ancient basilisk egg the archaeologists have unearthed.

  **Campaign Note:** This is Lady Johnson's plantation estate and the party's home base.

  ***

- ### 812. ABANDONED CAMP

  Forlorn tents, empty wagons, and cold fire pits make up this abandoned campsite. The only thing missing are the people. Those can be found inside a giant anaconda that coils atop a heap of debris.

  **Treasure:** Inside the snake's belly:

- Tecuhan's gorilla-wife Rokara is among the victims
- Her gold arm band (100 gp)
- 200 gp
- A basilisk egg (100 gp)
- A Jeweled Ring (100 gp)

  ***

- ### 818. CULTIST HOLY SITE

  A pitted, stone amphitheater bowls down into a wide clearing, its steps culminating in a stage and altar. Around the perimeter are dozens of lifelike statues of human warriors in battle poses. These are petrified stone warriors who have earned the basilisk cult's highest honor.

  **Treasure:** A secret door on the altar hides a jade-carved **Amulet of Vitality**.

  ***

- ### 921. ZUCHOTL

  This towering citadel was once the seat of power for all Itzalca people. More than 1,000 years ago, the Pale Queen led a horde of Azarummian warriors (006) against it, scattering the Itzalca to the wind. Now the citadel lies abandoned, its advanced wonders of magic and science left to rot in eerie halls of exquisitely carved jade and red jasper.

  **Current State:** Small tribes of criminals and outcasts have slowly crept inside; they wage fruitless wars against each other for territory and revenge.

  **Lost Treasure:** Much of the citadel's treasure remains lost, including **The Orb of All-Eyes** (a globe that elevates the INT and WIS of any who wields it to 18).

  **Campaign Note:** Target of Colonel Huzzard's military expedition.

  ***

- ### 1015. FLOODED RUINS\*

  A crumbling, stone ziggurat reaches out of a jungle-covered island surrounded on all sides by the swiftly flowing Black River. Floodwater has broken through its sturdy walls and settled into its chambers. Time-worn statues and carvings of weeping, robed women are utterly foreign to Itzalca design motifs.

  **Reputation:** The people of Tiwara (716) view the ziggurat as an accursed place where lost ghosts cry in the night and the roaming dead gather.

  **See:** [Flooded Ruins.md](dungeons/Flooded%20Ruins.md) for complete dungeon details.

  ***

- ### 1106. STAR MAP TEMPLE\*

  **EXPLORED BY PARTY (Sessions 06-07)**

  An open-topped, marble temple stands at the foot of the mountains. Vines and moss twist up its white pillars. Inside, massive clockwork wheels rotate each day to track the position of the stars and planets. The earth shakes subtly whenever these great wheels turn.

  **Warning:** Carved warnings mark solar eclipses: "On this day, enemies of life itself pour forth from the obsidian temples."

  **History:** Ancient Itzalca built this monument while they still occupied Zuchotl (921). They have since forgotten its location and purpose.

  **See:** [Star Map Temple.md](dungeons/Star%20Map%20Temple.md) for complete dungeon details.

  **Campaign Note:** Maied the treant was killed here in Session 07.

  ***

- ### 1109. DESTROYED VILLAGE

  The blackened and burned ruins of a village lies at the feet of its assassin — the volcano Chanichu (1405). A blanket of ash wraps around the charred foundations that once held up homes and temples.

  **Treasure:** The treasures that endured the fire are still buried in the debris, including the **Circlet of the Catfish** that allows its wielder to breathe underwater and swim as easily as a fish.

  **Taboo:** The Itzalca dare not speak the name of this haunted place lest Chanichu's wrath turn toward them next.

  ***

- ### 1220. BLOODSPEARS

  An insular tribe of 40 red-scaled lizardfolk called the Bloodspears lives in a boggy clearing. Their chieftain, a hulking lizardfolk named Ulesk, resides on a tiny island surrounded by a crocodile-filled moat.

  **Activity:** The Bloodspears use rafts to attack travelers along the nearby river; they currently hold Hiromandus, the master canoe craftsman from Tiwara (716), hostage. They are forcing him to make canoes they will use to launch attacks on the Itzalca villages upriver.

  ***

- ### 1302. BIBOLGA

  The 200 Itzalca of this village practice the old ways of their people. They build homes of dried red clay and revere the basilisk cultists (201, 706), sending them a child in tribute every year.

  **Leader:** Rasamiru - a proud young man of only 19 years. He adheres to tradition and does not take kindly to those who oppose the basilisk cultists or who seek the forbidden obsidian temple (1603) in the mountains.

  ***

- ### 1304. LORD HEDRON

  Lord Hedron Antioch was once a preeminent explorer and archaeologist, but a fateful encounter with Obe-Ixx left him as a vampire in her service. She commanded him to use his knowledge to learn about the obsidian temples (213, 514, 1603), but not to enter them himself.

  **Operation:** Lord Hedron operates out of a mountain cave and will use his rakish charm, wealth, and fame to recruit adventurers into exploring the Eclipse Dial (1603) on behalf of "a sickly scientist suffering from tropical illness" (an excuse to explain his pallor).

  ***

- ### 1309. THE CONFLUENCE

  Where Chanichu's (1405) lava flow meets the river, a roiling cloud of steam and gas cloaks the air in an eternal haze. During the day, diffuse sunlight paints the thick cloud yellow but does nothing to improve the poor visibility inside it. Whirls of fog sometimes eddy away to reveal blackened earth and dead wildlife.

  **Danger:** Here, void beings that have leaked from their containments find refuge from the sun. They hunt with unerring accuracy; any PCs who enter this hex have a random encounter from the Cursed table.

  ***

- ### 1405. CHANICHU\*

  An endless river of lava flows down Chanichu's flanks and through a mountain vale, merging with the Black River in a mighty clash of the elements (1309).

  **Inhabitants:** Rare flocks of fiery bird-crocodiles called skandrill live at the volcano's base. These raptors thrive in intense heat and have a raven's eye for precious stones and metals. They hoard rubies, pearls, and gold taken from unfortunate explorers in their lava-cave lairs.

  **See:** [Chanichu.md](dungeons/Chanichu.md) for complete dungeon details.

  ***

- ### 1413. OLD ISTRIL

  A fiercely independent old woman named Istril (archmage) moved out to the far reaches of the jungle for some peace and quiet. She prefers the deadly law of the wilds to the stuffy, bureaucratic humdrum of urban society.

  **Defenses:** A carefully tended garden blooms around her humble homestead, all of it warded from hostile intruders by screaming skulls on pikes enchanted to throw bolts of lightning.

  **Knowledge:** Istril knows many rumors and legends, but she doesn't much like company. Her tiny pet monkey, Werner, is a master thief.

  ***

- ### 1511. PIRATE TREASURE

  A long-lost hoard of pirate treasure lies buried in the loamy earth beneath a mangrove tree. The tree's snaking roots have burst one of the four mahogany chests, pushing a few handfuls of gold coins to the surface.

  **Contents:**

- 500 gp
- Two sapphire statuettes of prowling jaguars (200 gp each)
- A gold-and-ivory chalice carved as a howling face (100 gp)
- **Potion of Vitality**
- **Genie Lamp**

  ***

- ### 1516. OATALI'S SHRINE

  A flock of pterodactyls roosts around the rim of a small sinkhole with a glimmering pool at the bottom. Inside the pool, an underwater tunnel leads to the age-old shrine of Oatali the Rainbow Snake, a primordial spirit of the jungle.

  **Guardians:** Three couatl in the shape of iridescent-scaled lizardfolk guard it. Each couatl presides over a gem-encrusted altar dedicated to the jungles (emeralds), the rivers (sapphires), and the sun (rubies).

  **Treasure:** A fourth altar houses the **Fangs of Oatali** - a brightly colored jewel-and-feather mantle that transforms its wearer into a couatl.

  ***

- ### 1603. ECLIPSE DIAL\*

  In the shadow of a high mountain peak, a glassy black structure clings to the cliff face like a hideous beetle. This massive oval has an open tunnel at its center that allows access. Inside, chambers full of dark and alien horrors terminate in a room housing a massive, toothed wheel.

  **Function:** Blood from a living creature allows it to turn. Aligning the Eclipse Dial's sharp teeth causes the moon itself to move, blocking out the sun in a total solar eclipse that endures a week.

  **Apocalypse:** This is the moment the void beings have waited for — they emerge en masse from the obsidian temples (213, 514) to enact widespread slaughter. They grease the Eclipse Dial with human blood thereafter to continue the eclipse.

  **See:** [Eclipse Dial.md](dungeons/Eclipse%20Dial.md) for complete dungeon details.

  ***

- ### 1617. ARMY ANTS\*

  A field of elephant-sized anthills jut from the jungle floor. Giant ants seethe in and out of their underground hive, dragging any smaller creatures they find to their deaths within. Their rotund queen lounges on a bed of bones, coins, and jewels.

  **See:** [Army Ants.md](dungeons/Army%20Ants.md) for complete dungeon details.
